      "Leave a reply Steve Taylor Ph.D From the standpoint of ordinary consciousness separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition Most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mind-space observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls As a result the normal human state is one of aloneness We’re always onlookers rather than participants We can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings Our inner being will always be sealed off from them Ego-separation also creates a sense of incompleteness Because we’re separate from the world we’re like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency There s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill (but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack Born-again Christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a god-shaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion can’t fill the hole either only provide the same (ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success As a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we don’t feel completely at home in the world We’re not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we don’t fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere Whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent In addition our ego-isolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance Our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean We feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there How can we possibly have any significance in relation to them How can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world The Wider Effects of Separateness However the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual In fact I would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history The human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord We try to complete ourselves and make ourselves significant by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions This desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes The separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to ‘feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective This makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we can’t sense the suffering we cause them So we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth The sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment It means that we experience a sense of ‘otherness to nature and that we can’t sense its aliveness and as a result we don’t feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it Why Separateness I wouldn’t exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many non-duality teachers would Not an illusion but an aberration something which exists but shouldn’t Children don’t experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world This is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there There are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults don’t exist in a state of separateness Most of the world s indigenous peoples don’t see themselves as separate to their environment They feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation (and one which is no more important than any other As Tim Ingold writes of the Batek Negritos of Malaysia for example They see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala [spirits (including the deities which inhabit their world Or as the Cherokee Indian scholar Rebecca Adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole The Hopi use the term Novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the Tlingit (also of North America call it Shogan The anthropologist Lucien Levy-Bruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and ill-defined He noted that rather than existing as self-sufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land He cites reports of native peoples who used the word I when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death (This is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands The naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too For us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy But Australian Aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives Their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe Other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names The sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development For us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens The ego develops as a structure creating a sense of inner-ness and walling us off Witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence Especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion After being a part of the glorious flow of experience we’re suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space This is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging Their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions More bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults With their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status I remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence After a carefree childhood I suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience Along with that I felt an acute self-consciousness I was aware of every movement I made and every word I spoke so that I couldn’t do anything naturally anymore I felt exposed when I walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows As they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments They take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge they’ve accumulated to their self-image as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people These roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off Awakening From the Sleep of Separateness However no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense it’s never more than superficial No matter how strong the ego becomes it’s never more than a construct Everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again These are what I refer to as awakening experiences They frequently occur when we’re walking amongst natural surroundings when we’re dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music In these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries Separateness dissolves and we’re afloat on the ocean of Being again immersed in the glorious is-ness and aliveness of the world Tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift We feel that we’ve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you The ego-self we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity There are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the ego’s building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away A person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on In most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening With all its scaffolding broken down the normal ego-self dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar The person feels re-born like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection In all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from It was always there it is always here It’s just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep Steve Taylor holds a Ph.D in Transpersonal Psychology and is a senior

      " by Carey Wedler A business owner in Manhattan is suing the city after being forced to waive his Fourth Amendment rights and potentially forfeit his business because an NYPD officer sold illegal goods at his store You read that right According to a lawsuit filed this month by the Institute for Justice a libertarian legal advocacy group an undercover NYPD detective attempted to sell stolen electronics to customers at Sung Cho’s laundromat in Inwood which located near the northern tip of Manhattan in 2013 After the officer successfully sold stolen goods to two people one inside the store and one outside the city threatened Cho with eviction merely because a ‘stolen property offense had happened at his business the legal organization’s website explained Institute for Justice (IJ) which takes on cases involving the suppression of free speech eminent domain and civil asset forfeiture among other government encroachments detailed Cho’s case The city presented Sung with a choice See his business shut down or sign an agreement giving up constitutional rights—including his Fourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless searches of his business Faced with the imminent closure of his laundromat Sung had no real choice but to sign Under the city’s decades-old nuisance eviction ordinance residents and business owners can be evicted simply because an illegal act occurred on or near their property Though the law was passed in the 1970s to target businesses that encourage illegal activity like many laws it has been abused Under the ordinance the identity of the criminal offender is irrelevant IJ explains You can be evicted because a total stranger (or a friend or family member decided your home or business was a good place to commit a crime According to IJ, in many cases the ‘proof of the alleged criminal offense is an affidavit from an NYPD officer relaying vague allegations from unnamed confidential informants A joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Daily News reported that in Cho’s case the police claimed in court filings that [his business was facilitating an illegal fencing operation because the undercover detective sold illegal goods there in 2013 None of Cho’s employees were ever accused of or charged with a crime Nevertheless in cases like Cho’s the city often offers to drop the charges but only if the defendant agrees to relinquish their constitutional rights Some are forced to sign agreements waiving their Fourth Amendment rights IJ explains According to ProPublica and the Daily News Cho agreed to give up his right to a hearing before being fined and agreeing to be shut down if police accuse anybody at his shop of breaking the law in the future He also must allow the police to search his business and access his security footage at any time The terms continue in perpetuity and pass on to any new buyer or partner in Cho’s business which he said makes it essentially worthless I couldn’t really defend myself that’s why we had to settle prior to going to the judge Cho said Just because it happened nearby under the law I am guilty and that is not right The ordinance is being abused in other ways as well As IJ explains Others are forced to sign agreements barring family members from the home—including family members who have not been accused of any crime This was the case of Jameelah El-Shabazz also represented in IJ’s suit who was forced to ban her son from her home She was required to do so after he was falsely accused of possessing 45 cups of cocaine during a police search of a bedroom at her residence in 2011 Laboratory tests proved her son did not have cocaine or any other narcotic she says the powder the NYPD found was crushed eggshells he uses for spiritual rituals Though no charges were ever pressed four months later she was served with the nuisance case and an order forcing her from her apartment while the case was being decided ProPublica and the New York Daily News reported She says that when she signed the agreement she had no idea it meant she had to permanently ban her son from her home I’m not going to make my son homeless because of the false accusations she said The ProPublica/Daily News investigation reports that of over 1,100 cases in which these notices were issued during 2013 and the first half of 2014 fewer than half of the individuals targeted had actually committed a crime They reported the cases occurred almost exclusively in black and Latino communities IJ’s suit follows another similar lawsuit concerning a woman who was evicted from her home for four days after police claimed drugs were illegally sold there As it turned out those engaging in illegal activity had moved out eight months prior Though Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the lawsuit saying he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial city attorney Nicholas Ciapetta claimed in a recent motion that the woman was not entitled to any additional process The city’s law department said it has not yet seen IJ’s new case filing Though the NYPD has amended its use of the ordinance to restrict full closures on homes while nuisance cases are still being decided they continue to endorse the law This is one of many important tools we use as part of precision policing to continue to drive down crime and protect the public Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said But Cho disagrees It’s unfair he asserted Unfair to me unfair to all the investment that I made here unfair to the employees that work here and support their families…it’s New York City versus a little guy like me Robert Johnson the lead attorney on the case representing Cho El-Shabazz and one other individual strongly objected to the practice The mere fact that someone’s been arrested is just not a reason why they should be kicked out of an apartment he said The case was filed in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York Johnson said IJ is prepared to take the case against the coercively obtained settlements all the way to the Supreme Court If they win past waivers of constitutional rights will be declared unenforceable and going forward this practice will be put to an end once and for all Delivered by The Daily Sheeple We encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos Click for details Contributed by The Anti-Media of theantimedia.org The Anti in our name does not mean we are against the media we are simply against the current mainstream paradigm The current media influenced by the industrial complex is a top-down authoritarian system of distribution—the opposite of what Anti-Media aims to be At Anti-Media we want to offer a new paradigm—a bottom-up approach for real and diverse reporting We seek to establish a space where the people are the journalists and a venue where independent journalism moves forward on a larger and more truthful scale \n",

      "BREAKING: Racketeering indictment of Hillary Clinton now ‘likely as FOIA for Datto backup device reveals FBI possesses ALL the incriminating emails Mike Adams The Health Ranger NaturalNews Natural News can now reveal that dozens of democrat operatives will be facing criminal indictment from damning email evidence that has been in the possession of the FBI for more than a year The bad news is that such indictments may take months to formally announce with criminal proceedings requiring years to reach a conclusion The good news is that Hillary Clinton isn’t going to get away with her criminal racketeering for much longer as the U.S. intelligence community is now determined to make sure she faces justice regardless of the outcome of next Tuesday’s election Here’s the evidence that supports these assertions First FBI sources have told Fox News Bret Baier that an indictment is likely From Real Clear Politics Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is likely in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation barring some obstruction in some way from the Justice Department No doubt Loretta Lynch is determined to engage in that obstruction in one form or another which is probably why Lynch herself may be among those who are eventually indicted for criminal conspiracy Second this Oct 28 announcement from Dr Larry Kawa working in partnership with

communications to light He is now calling for full disclosure of a hard drive that was turned over by Datto Inc to the FBI as of 2015 According to CNN, the contents of the Datto hard drive are believed to contain all of Hillary Clinton’s backed up electronic communications from her time as Secretary of State The Datto device backups are now in the hands of the FBI It turns out that Datto Inc is a data backup company which had real-time access to Hillary Clinton’s private email server for the purpose of backing up her emails That backup data set was turned over to the FBI in 2015 but the FBI likely did not realize what they were holding at the time It wasn’t until the Clinton Foundation email scandal began to unfold that FBI agents realized what they possessed Now it turns out the FBI has been sorting through those emails (and other evidence for more than a year In addition and this is a real shocker for those who have been following this the FBI did not destroy the laptops from Clinton’s co-conspirators Via Real Clear Politics The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed and agents are currently combing through them Now the FBI has at least FOUR sources of damning emails with overwhelming criminal evidence of Hillary Clinton’s racketeering enterprise What all this means now is that the FBI has four sources of emails that Hillary Clinton and her close associates attempted to destroy Source #1 Anthony Weiner’s laptop which somehow seems to have held 650,000 of Huma Abedin’s emails if reports are true in addition to whatever child sexting pervert pics Weiner himself had collected (yeah he’s a democrat Source #2 The non-destroyed laptops of Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson which the media incorrectly reported had been destroyed as part of the FBI’s investigation conclusion earlier this year Source #3 The Datto Inc backup device which has already been turned over the FBI and likely contains all of Hillary Clinton’s emails that she attempted to destroy (via Bleach Bit Source #4 Wikileaks dumps of John Podesta emails which keep getting posted in large batches like clockwork day after day revealing astonishing layers of corruption and collusion among dozens of key players conspiring with the Clintons From these four sources of emails an undeniable pattern of criminal racketeering emerges All this evidence isn’t just going to incriminate Hillary Clinton by the way This vast conspiracy of criminal collusion corruption pay-to-pay bribery and racketeering will ensnare dozens if not hundreds of DNC operatives and Clinton Foundation cohorts (Can we please release some non-violent drug offenders from the prisons to make room for the Clinton brigade In case you didn’t already realize this we’re now watching the uncovering of a massive criminal conspiracy involving hundreds of willing participants spanning the DNC, the Dept of Justice the White House the Clinton Foundation and of course the State Department When it’s all said and done this will be the largest criminal conspiracy ever uncovered in the history of the United States of America And it was all masterminded by a woman who claims that her vagina gives her some sort of special privilege to ascend to power in America The only downside to all this is that it might take years to fully prosecute the criminal cases against these Clinton criminals and no doubt many of those who are guilty of committing these crimes will go free in exchange for testifying against their racketeering bosses But the Clinton house of cards is now destined to fall eventually ending one of the most shocking and dark chapters of American history and government corruption Hillary Clinton’s private email server was hacked by FIVE foreign intelligence agencies says FBI source Beyond everything mentioned above Hillary Clinton’s illegal private email server has long since been compromised by multiple foreign intelligence agencies allowing any of them to easily BLACKMAIL Clinton if she were to become President Via Real Clear Politics FBI sources say with 99 accuracy that Hillary Clinton’s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies and that information had been taken from it This means that from the very first moment Hillary Clinton might seize power in Washington D.C. she would be at the mercy of Chinese Russian North Korean or possibly even Iranian political leaders who would issue blackmail threats against her unless she granted them requested political favors Notably the entire leftist media is communicating absolutely none of this to its readers and viewers counting on the true fact that most Clinton supporters are too stupid or too self-deluded to understand the high stakes game of international geopolitics As a result people who continue to say they support Hillary Clinton are astonishingly helping elect a criminal kingpin into the highest office the land even as she has already been deeply compromised by foreign enemies that seek the outright destruction of the United States This is likely why the U.S. intelligence services part of the deep state apparatus has now turned against Hillary Clinton and has made a decision to take her down What every informed person now realizes both in government and outside it is that Hillary Clinton poses a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States of America and that allowing her to seize power in Washington would spell outright doom for the nation and its people Why the Huffington Post is also a danger to America Remember this as you browse the internet Every website that’s trying to get Clinton elected including the Huffington Post is working to place a seditious racketeering criminal into the highest office of the land Such malicious acts are in their own right serious crimes against America yet they characterize the entire delusional left-wing media and blogosphere widely populated by academics who are so ignorant about the real world that they are incapable of recognizing the rise of a fascist totalitarian regime even as it emerges in front of their very eyes Universities no longer teach students anything about the real world you see so a person can emerge from a top-tier university with a PhD while being so ignorant and deluded about reality that they would gladly vote for another Adolf Hitler if he dressed up in rainbow colors chanted love wins and claimed to be transgender (Bonus question Could a biological man with a penis claim to self-identify as a woman and run for office under the premise of being the first woman president Cognitively obedient liberals who are all completely insane morons would no doubt vote for the woman achieving the incredible distinction of placing the first female into the White House who also had a scrotum and could pee standing up Liberal historians take note this is somehow called equality Every website rooting for Hillary Clinton is blindly pursuing the total damnation of America all under the guise of social justice or the silly pursuit of the first female President as if possessing a vagina is some sort of magical qualification for political superiority Imagine their mutual surprise when they soon discover that a vagina-possessing liberal politician turned out to be the most corrupt dishonest and dangerous presidential candidate in history a woman who created a massive criminal cartel and collected hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits while selling government influence to the highest international bidders No penis required So much for the glass ceiling theory eh In summary Hillary Clinton is a woman who once held the world by the balls but then had to let go when the stank of her own putrid crimes was too much to stomach any longer In the end she will be remembered as nothing more than a crotchety old hag with a reptilian appetite for power and a sickening disregard for humankind Prepare your in-flight vomit bags folks because this final approach to election day is going to involve nauseating turbulence and more than a few stomach-churning freefalls \n",

      "Posted on November 3 2016 by Michael Collins Donald Trump’s post election experience may be as bad or worse than the nightmare he hopes to visit on Hillary Clinton perhaps worse Jane Doe proceeding under a pseudonym filed a civil lawsuit against Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeremy Epstein for multiple acts of sexual and physical abuse which occurred when the defendant was 13 years old Specifically the the plaintiff charged the defendants with Rape sexual misconduct criminal sexual acts sexual abuse forcible touching assault battery intentional and reckless inflection of emotional distress duress false imprisonment and defamation Jane Doe v Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein Judge Ronnie Abrams scheduled a December 16 2016 pretrial conference to set a timeline for the case in the U.S District Court Southern District in Manhattan The complaint argues for the use of Jane Doe rather than the plaintiff’s actual name This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature and identification of Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others The heart of Jane Doe’s complaint is summarized below Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a series of parties with other similarly situated minor females held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed exposed himself to Plaintiff and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff During the course of this savage sexual attack Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted Exhs A and B. Jane Doe v Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein The complaint against Epstein describes behavior similar to that of Trump Epstein a convicted sex offender Palm Beach Florida investigators produced a probable cause affidavit in 2006 that documented Jeffrey Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity with 4 minors and lewd and lascivious molestation The crimes took place at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion where he entertained lavishly Epstein hired Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershhowitz and former special prosecutor Kenneth Starr as his defense team Even though FBI and other investigations accumulated a victim list of 40 underage girls in Florida the case was settled in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution from underage girls He was sentenced to 18 months served 13 and had to register as a risk level 3-sex offender in New York (the highest level Trump brags about close friendship with Epstein Before Epstein’s legal problems Trump did a 2002 interview in New York Magazine in which he described a long-term relationship with Epstein I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years Terrific guy He’s a lot of fun to be with It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side No doubt about it Jeffrey enjoys his social life New York Magazine Trump had Epstein at a guest at his Florida mansion and Epstein had Trump as a guest as his estates in Florida and New York Will the case go forward if Trump wins the election If the case is not dismissed the scheduling conference on the December 16 will outline various tasks and dates over the first few months of 2017 including the dates for the inauguration of the 45 th President of the United States If that happens to be Donald Trump there is nothing to prevent the trial from going forward The Supreme Court decision in the Bill Clinton Paula Jones case established the right of citizens to sue presidents in civil court for acts committed prior to taking office If the case moves forward the evidence in the exhibits and subsequent information the quality of representation at trial and the judge and jury are the central factors that will determine if a sitting president or losing presidential candidate will do some serious time for the heinous crimes alleged Unlike the original Epstein case the visibility for this matter is so high backroom deals for the rich and famous will be virtually impossible \n",

      "Leave a reply The 7 Maoi facing the equinox sunset at Ahu Akivi on Easter Island (photo copyright Ian Sewell Paul Rosenberg Civilization has to be transmitted from one generation to another If it isn’t processes break down and life becomes difficult Soon there must be a painful reform or else the civilization will be lost This is fundamentally the job of families (especially parents but at the moment that’s not really possible How many families can survive on one income And if one of the parents can’t stay home and teach the fundamental lessons of civilization who will pass them to the next generation Certainly the better daycare facilities try but to think that someone watching a couple dozen kids is going to transmit civilization to them as effectively as a parent who’s with the child day and night is simply ridiculous The blame for this rests almost solely at the feet of the state of course but we’re getting ahead of ourselves I’ll begin by quoting the redoubtable Fred Reed on the current situation We live in a dying culture and soon a diminished country It cannot be saved Not true Add up the bits and pieces We laugh in horror some of us primarily the older at the decline of schooling the courses like Batman and the Struggle for Gender Equity Comic yes Yet in aggregate these constitute an academic and civilizational collapse both profound and irreversible Enstupidation does not happen in a healthy country Who even wants to reverse this onrushing night Not the universities nor the teacher’s unions nor a professoriat gone as daft as the students nor the banks battening on student loans [sic I’m more optimistic than Fred in that I think our civilization can be saved But what he writes is true and the West’s big institutions are simply vampires sucking the blood of a declining civilization I think we can all admit that every major institution of the West including the mega-corps is engaged in stripping the Western populace of everything they possibly can There is no virtue involved no principle no honor there’s not even much consideration for the future These outfits under whatever excuses they’re trotting out this year are strip-mining Western civilization not building it That said let’s look at some particular villains The Political Correctness Barbarians When I first saw these people rising to power decades ago now I thought they were so ridiculous that they’d come and go quickly Unfortunately I was wrong and they subverted millions of children The current insanity over safe spaces and such condemns them openly and especially that it’s becoming acceptable to say I hate white people Anti-Religionists It’s one thing to be a simple agnostic It’s quite another to go out and try to dismember religion which in nearly every case means Christianity And to be honest about it most people who do this are acting out their personal traumas either in permanent rebellion to their parents or in anger at one church or another Slashing and burning things simply bears bad fruit but here’s the core issue with attacking Christianity The people who pushed Christianity out of Western culture were arrogant and destructive not that they pushed it away but that they never bothered to replace it If you want to remove the moral core of a civilization you have to replace it with something better And the religion-haters did not They sawed off the limb that held them and were too arrogant to consider the consequences Academia and the Education Vampires The Enlightenment sits before us as a twisted wreckage Its destruction followed the usual path first setting up institutions then monopolies and fiefdoms and finally lording it over others as far and as long as they could Education has whored itself out to the state and treats its students as income-generating tools Are there a few exceptions I’m sure there are but they are few Academia including most of scientific academia has disgraced itself Could any serious Enlightenment thinker have respected scientific consensus Please Science places experimentation above all and never ever sells itself to a page full of names and initials The scientific process has been subjugated by institutions that thrive on restricting access Cronyism is massive peer review is corrupted and the uncredentialed are treated like lepers These institutions sit atop the corpse of the Enlightenment Corporatized Art The arts music film painting sculpture are not widgets They are immensely more important than that forming minds and cultures in deep ways How to pay the artist (singer writer whatever has long been a problem and remains one Hopefully a good answer arises at some point Until then seeking profit by dumbing down every art form is simply degrading The corporations that now control music and film have bastardized art for money I’m not ready to jail them and I certainly don’t think the state could do a better job but I am willing to say that they have disgraced art Have you ever wondered why elegance is gone Why loudness and drunkenness are treated as virtues The State Being that it forcibly skims half of the West’s production every year given that it punishes all who do not obey it and given that its laws are for sale to the highest bidders the number one destroyer of Western civilization is the state Hands down Think of what people could do for their children and grandchildren with twice as much money And don’t get me started on enforced charity the victim culture you didn’t build that and it takes a village I don’t like to swear in print A Final Point I could go on but this is a column not a treatise My final point is this None of the above are transmitting civilization even if some of them once did They are tools for reaping the masses and we need to leave them behind But far more importantly we need to build methods and systems that will transmit Western civilization The authentic Western virtues cooperation initiative creativity curiosity co-dominance and real justice (not merely a form thereof are necessary for a prosperous humanity and the institutions of our time have flamboyantly failed It’s time to start building afresh

      "By John W. Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means unseen and unheard by Congress the President or the people Outwardly we have a Constitutional government We have operating within our government and political system a well-organized political-action group in this country determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly silently continuously to transform our Government This group is answerable neither to the President the Congress nor the courts It is practically irremovable Senator William Jenner 1954 speech Unaffected by elections Unaltered by populist movements Beyond the reach of the law Say hello to America’s shadow government A corporatized militarized entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are in essence running the country this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry No matter which candidate wins the presidential election this shadow government is here to stay Indeed as recent documents by the FBI reveal this shadow government also referred to as The 7th Floor Group —may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year To be precise however the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments The first shadow government referred to as COG or Continuity of Government is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstances—a terrorist attack a natural disaster an economic meltdown—to bring it out of the shadows where it operates even now When and if COG takes over the police state will transition to martial law Yet it is the second shadow government —also referred to as the Deep State—that poses the greater threat to freedom right now Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats corporations contractors paper-pushers and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our government The Deep State which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government So who or what is the Deep State It’s the militarized police which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army It’s the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects It’s the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice It’s the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation It’s the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government It’s what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies the Department of Defense the State Department Homeland Security the CIA, the Justice Department the Treasury the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court a handful of vital federal trial courts and members of the defense and intelligence committees It’s every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the government’s power grabs corruption and abusive tactics These are the key players that drive the shadow government This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office Domestic surveillance No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest the National Security Agency (NSA) with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone Thus on any given day whether you’re walking through a store driving your car checking email or talking to friends and family on the phone you can be sure that some government agency whether the NSA or some other entity is listening in and tracking your behavior Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets purses briefcases etc Full-body scanners which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane have gone mobile with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alike—including homes Coupled with the nation’s growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide Global spying The NSA’s massive surveillance network what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion espionage empire will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer The NSA’s Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call fax and email message sent anywhere in the world In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International Greenpeace and several religious groups Echelon has also been a keystone in the government’s attempts at political and corporate espionage Roving TSA searches The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables Considered essential to national security TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country USA Patriot Act NDAA America’s so-called war on terror which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11 will continue to chip away at our freedoms unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens In so doing they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law rather than the U.S. Constitution is the map by which we navigate life in the United States These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected Militarized police state Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military complete with jackboots helmets shields batons pepper-spray stun guns assault rifles body armor miniature tanks and weaponized drones Having been given the green light to probe poke pinch taser search seize strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance all with the general blessing of the courts America’s law enforcement officials no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace will continue to keep the masses corralled controlled and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens SWAT team raids With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise Nationwide SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs domestic disputes improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer and misdemeanor marijuana possession Domestic drones The domestic use of drones will continue unabated As mandated by Congress there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020 all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year These machines which will be equipped with weapons will be able to record all activities using video feeds heat sensors and radar An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically largely for use by the FBI with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones School-to-prison pipeline The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment suspension or expulsion from school accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court Overcriminalization The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws statutes codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies rendering the rest of us petty criminals The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal Consequently small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided Privatized Prisons States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states the states have to agree to maintain a 90 occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years Endless wars America’s expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health education welfare and safety Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense Are you getting the message yet The next president much like the current president and his predecessors will be little more than a figurehead a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from what’s really going on As Lofgren reveals this state within a state concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out connected to but only intermittently controlled by the visible state whose leaders we choose The Deep State not only holds the nation’s capital in thrall but it also controls Wall Street which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater and Silicon Valley This is fascism in its most covert form hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats As Lofgren concludes he Deep State is so heavily entrenched so well protected by surveillance firepower money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda In other words as I point out in my book Battlefield America The War on the American People as long as government officials—elected and unelected alike—are allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution the courts and the citizenry the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates remember that it’s just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by America’s shadow government Constitutional attorney and author John W.

      "Science Alert Tue 25 Oct 2016 Hints of an unidentified extinct human species have been found in the DNA of modern Melanesians those living in a region of the South Pacific northeast of Australia According to new genetic modelling the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record but could represent a third unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists We’re missing a population or we’re misunderstanding something about the relationships Ryan Bohlender a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today and say they’ve found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn’t the whole story It’s thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago our early ancestors migrated out of Africa and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes And that’s not all they’ve given us Earlier this year researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals and found that they’re associated with several health problems including a slightly increased risk of depression heart attack and a number of skin disorders And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa While our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched how we interacted with the Denisovans the distant cousins of Neanderthals is less clear The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 Using a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry on average between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. But when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu the Solomon Islands Fiji Papua New Guinea New Caledonia West Papua and the Maluku Islands As Hesman Saey explains for Science News Europeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry and people in China have a tiny amount 0.1 percent according to Bohlender’s calculations But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians Human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was he told her This find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands As we reported last month this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth dating back more than 50,000 years ago But the results revealed something else DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third unidentified hominid Who this group is we don’t know lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey Until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice we can’t prove this and we should point out that Bohlender’s estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed so they might shift with further scrutiny And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth But the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we’d assumed which shouldn’t be much of a surprise when you think about it Just because we don’t see them in the fossil record doesn’t mean they didn’t exist preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn’t easy and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up Hopefully the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies the more hints we’ll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn’t make it to modern times The results of Bohlender’s analysis were presented last week at the 2016 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Canada Guido Amrein Switzerland/Shutterstock Melanesian children of Papua New Guinea Share \n",

      "From Marina Abramovic <marinaxabramovic@gmail.com ;mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com Date June 28 2015 at 2:35:08 AM GMT+2 To Tony Podesta <podesta@podesta.com ;mailto:podesta@podesta.com Subject Dinner Dear Tony I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining All my love Marina There is much more to the Abramovic-Podesta-Clinton connection than this one e-mail and the social event it makes reference to and much more than we can cover in this article However the MSM pro-Clinton press corps has studiously avoided these ties except in the few instances where they have ventured into the cesspool to declare that there really is no cess there That was the tack taken by Eric Levitz in a November 4 piece for New York Magazine a reliable cheering section for Team Hillary throughout the campaign season Entitled Spirit Cooking Explained Satanic Ritual of Fun Dinner Levitz describes Tony Podesta as a powerful lobbyist and a prominent collector of contemporary art The message here is ostensibly a dinner invitation that makes playful reference to one of Abramovic’s past works writes Levitz Yes just a playful fun dinner that’s all But according to Levitz the tin-foil hat conspiracy wackos of the far-right fever swamp have turned this innocent dinner gathering of the Podesta clan and their artistic muse into something sinister Well Mr Levitz like the Podestas the Clintons Lady Gaga and Abramovic apparently hales from a different precinct (if not a completely different planet or universe than most normal moral decent Americans who would be inclined to find the Abramovic dinner art both creepy and sinister Levitz is not unaware of Abramovic’s ultra-dark side he includes an imbedded video in his article of her performing her infamous Spirit Cooking (Warning graphic content viewer discretion advised The New York mag writer slams the Alex Jones/Info Wars website and Drudge Report for making an issue of these innocuous goings on they’re obviously unsophisticated rubes with no appreciation for high-toned culture right There ain’t no Satanists here you fools just artistic types enjoying some campy fun Right Well Drudge and Jones are probably a lot closer to the mark than Levitz Besides the Spirit Cooking video Alex Jones includes (among other evidence a Marina Abramovic portrait (shown above in which she frames her face with the horns of a bloody goat skull the symbol of Baphomet one of the most common Satanic images Other portraits of the artist can be found online showing her with a mouthful of live snakes as well as her signature fixation on death cannibalism and in general the lewd crude nude and rude Marina Abramovic an unquenchable narcissist apparently is unsettled by the sudden critical attention since she is used to being worshipped and fawned over On November 4 she exploded with the Tweets I am not a Satanist Stop it and My friends please stop twittering me with tag spiritcooking Just enjoy art and stop asking me about politics Unfortunately for her she must have forgotten that her Twitter account she used in an attempt to dispel the Spirit Cooking occultism is @AbramovicM666 Probably not the wisest move she’s made (For an additional spirited and rational discussion of the Spirit Cooking e-mails and their related context see also Spirit Cooking Evil In Government Mike Cernovich Vox Day and Stefan Molyneux The Clinton-Podesta-Abramovic tie-in might be written off by many doubters as merely a titillating sensational election-eve story scraped up by political opponents However it cannot be written off so easily because it goes to the heart of darkness of the Clinton organized crime cesspool that the FBI’s former assistant director James Kallstrom referred to It comes on the heels of a long train of verified stories that are interrelated most especially regarding criminal activities with minors and children There is for starters the long-running close relationship between hedge fund billionaire (and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein whose Manhattan mansion and private island estate in the Caribbean have been the sites for many notorious sex parties especially for Democratic politicians celebrities and high-end political donors Bill and Hillary Clinton reportedly have made multiple trips to Epstein’s lair known as Sex Slave Island which offers a luxurious getaway excursion outside the jurisdiction of authorities who might get in the way of sexual frolicking with teens and even younger kids Hillary Clinton’s ties to Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner and the most recent revelations coming from his computer underscore the fact that at the highest levels of power in Washington D.C. top officals of both parties for many years have been winking at the criminal sexual exploitation of children by politicians and their high-placed friends Only rarely do the offenses leak out in a way that ends up with prosecution of the powerful as in the case of Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert a serial abuser of teenage boys But as we have reported Hastert was just the tip of the iceberg Related to this same subject matter are e-mails between Hillary Clinton and her then-top aide Cheryl Mills regarding one Laura Silsby who was arrested and charged with child abduction and child trafficking in Haiti after the island was devastated by a hurricane in January 2010 Silsby and nine others posing as missionaries for a non-existent Christian orphanage were apprehended by authorities while attempting to smuggle a busload of 33 Haitian children off the island Turns out they weren’t orphans after all and their parents accused Silsby of deception Silsby’s attorney was convicted felon Jorge Torres Puello who at the time was a fugitive from U.S. authorities for alien smuggling That should have sent up a red flag or two (Torres Puello was subsequently captured prosecuted and sentenced to three years in U.S. federal prison for alien smuggling However thanks to intercession by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton (who was serving as special UN envoy to Haiti as well as ramrodding his own very profitable Clinton Foundation ventures in the tragedy-struck island Laura Silsby’s charges were reduced and she was allowed to leave Haiti with time served Some analysts and critics have suggested that Silsby was kidnapping the Haitian children to be sold to child sex rings The evidence we have seen thus far does not prove that claim but neither is it a far-fetched supposition considering the sordid sexual swamp that many of the high and mighty are mired in and considering the Epstein-Clinton-Podesta revelations that are pouring out At the very least it must be seriously investigated in light of the evidence available and the global crisis in child sex trafficking But here as in virtually every other scandal that has embroiled Hillary Clinton her establishment media pals have given her a Teflon shield Ditto for the revelations by Kathy Shelton of Arkansas who as a 12-year-old was raped in 1975 by a 41-year-old drifter Hillary Clinton was his defense lawyer In a later interview Clinton laughed as she recalled how she had gotten her child-rapist client off with some courtroom tricks Moreover as the victim recounts Hillary made it appear that the 12-year-old Shelton was the one at fault Hillary Clinton lied terrorized mocked me defending my rapist Shelton has tweeted While the latest WikiLeaks releases related to sensational sexual matters are grabbing the headlines of the alternative media (and being ignored by the MSM) literally dozens of other hot issues exposed by WikiLeaks from the Clinton-Podesta e-mails have been either totally buried or hugely under-reported by the Clintonista press corps In addition to the WikiLeaks revelations (and related exposés that we have covered in the articles listed below this story we point you to a helpful summary of several dozen Clinton scandals compiled by Montana researcher activist Clarice Ryan for the Gem State Patriot In addition there is a more detailed annotated online

      "Posted by Michael Snyder I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner Now that the FBI is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign But if the FBI does quickly take action it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate In fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race For example the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside So what should the Democrats do now If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process They would demand that Mrs Clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee Sen Tim Kaine of Virginia stand in her place Democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election In a previous article I included a quote from a U.S. News World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th If Clinton were to fall off the ticket Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee Who would they choose Let’s take a look at the top five options #1 Tim Kaine He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton’s running mate But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail In fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run But according to the vice president the short answer is no The only thing that kept him from running Biden said was the recent death of his son Beau Unfortunately for Biden he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does Biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesn’t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers Biden would probably represent the safest choice for the Democrats but he might not be a winning choice #3 Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders First of all he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats He has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over Secondly the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this Thirdly Democratic insiders fear that he would be another McGovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election So even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the Bernie Sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman So she is definitely a possibility But she does lack name recognition and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as another McGovern because of her far left policies #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton And these days Barack Obama’s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11 So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very well-liked by the American people And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently For instance her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign in a recent MSN article entitled In this campaign Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice The speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented Obama’s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority Three months before leaving the White House she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title When you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said Anita McBride former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University We know she didn’t like politics But she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out People listen to her If I were the Democrats Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her In the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen And if it does happen it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream

      " Recipient Email The Iraqi Army has entered Mosul for the first time in over two years at the start of a battle which is likely to end in a decisive defeat for Isis The significance of the fight for Mosul will be all the greater for Isis because its self-declared caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is believed to be still inside the city a senior Kurdish official has told The Independent Fuad Hussein chief of staff to Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said in an exclusive interview that his government had information from multiple sources that Baghdadi is there and if he is killed it will mean the collapse of the whole [Isis system Isis would have to choose a new caliph in the middle of a battle but no successor would have the authority and prestige of Baghdadi the leader who surprised the world by establishing the caliphate after capturing Mosul in June 2014 Baghdadi has kept himself concealed for the last eight or nine months according to Mr Hussein who added that the caliph had become very dependent on Isis commanders from Mosul and Tal Afar a city just to the west of Mosul Other senior and better known figures in Isis particularly those from Syria and other countries have been killed since their initial triumphs in the summer of 2014 when they took over much of northern Iraq and eastern Syria The presence of Baghdadi in Mosul may complicate and prolong the battle for Mosul as his surviving adherents fight to the death to defend him Mr Hussein said that it is obvious that they will lose but not how long this will take to happen He said that Kurdish Peshmerga forces had been impressed by the extraordinary number of tunnels that Isis had dug in order to provide hiding places in the villages around Mosul Iraqi Special Forces advanced into Mosul which once had a population of two million on Tuesday seizing the state television on the east bank of the Tigris River that divides the city in half Mr Hussein said that the speed of the fall of Mosul would depend on many factors especially whether or not Isis is going to destroy the five bridges over the river Iraqi army units backed by US-led air strikes have been attacking across the Nineveh Plain to the east of Mosul capturing empty towns and villages from which the inhabitants have almost entirely fled Where Christians and other minorities have tried to return to their old homes in towns like Bartella and Qaraqosh they have found them looted and often burned by retreating Isis fighters Iraqi troops entered Gogjali a district inside Mosul’s city limits and later the borders of the more built-up Karama district according to Major General Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces Under an agreement reached before the offensive began on 17 October Kurdish Peshmerga and Shia-militia paramilitaries known as the Hashd al-Shaabi will not join the attack into Mosul which is a largely Sunni Arab city As night fell a sandstorm blew up cutting visibility to only 100 yards making air support for Iraqi forces more difficult and bringing the fighting to an end Daesh (Isis is fighting back and have set up concrete blast walls to block off the Karama neighbourhood and [stop our troops advance General Aridi said He added later that the troops had taken the nearby state television building the only one in Nineveh province but there had been heavy fighting when they tried to move further into built-up areas They are still some six miles from the city centre The anti-Isis offensive is dependent on US-led air strikes and the presence of US special forces I assure you that the Iraqi Army and the Peshmerga do not move one millimetre forward without American permission and coordination said one Kurdish observer He did not think that the battle for Mosul would necessarily go on a long time But it is increasingly difficult for the 3,000 to 5,000 Isis fighters in Mosul and the 1,500 to 2,500 on the outskirts to escape even if they wanted to The Iraqi Army and the Peshmerga encircle the city to the north east and west and the Hashd are moving in from the west cutting the last routes to Syria US spokesman Colonel John Dorrian said that the US-led airpowers had noticed that Isis forces could no longer move in large numbers And when we see them come together where there are significant numbers we will strike them and kill them he said during a televised press conference Some 1,792 Iraqis of whom 1,120 were civilians were killed in October according to the UN, though the total probably does not include Isis fighters Eyewitnesses inside Mosul where Isis is reported to have killed 40 Iraqi prisoners at the weekend and thrown their bodies into the Tigris say there are few fighters to be seen in the streets There are mostly just teenagers with guns said one Mosul resident reached by telephone Part of the city is shrouded in smoke because of air strikes and artillery fire but also because Isis fighters are lighting fires to produce a smokescreen which will make observation from the air more difficult It has been reported that Isis commanders were divided on whether or not it was better for them to make a last stand in Mosul or withdraw after inflicting the maximum number of casualties on its enemies and revert to guerrilla warfare Last month 100 Isis fighters staged a spectacular raid on the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk An advantage for Isis in fighting in Mosul is that it would be more difficult for the US and its allies to carry out air strikes because there may be up to 1.5 million civilians still in the city Isis has been preventing them leaving though the number is increasing as the anti-Isis forces move forward and it becomes clear that they intend to assault the city Isis has never been popular in Mosul according to local residents who detest its extreme violence religious bigotry and subjugation of women But it found more support in Sunni Arab villages around the city and among the Sunni Turkman of the nearby city of Tal Afar who have always been notorious for their religious extremism and hatred for Shia and Kurds Some observers believe that Isis might want to fight here against the Shia paramilitaries of the Hashd because the US-led air coalition has not been providing air cover for the Hashd on the grounds that they are sectarian and under Iranian influence The fighting is so far on the eastern side of Mosul that traditionally had a Kurdish and Christian population while if Isis has local support it will be in the overwhelmingly Sunni Arab west of the city Life here is said to be still relatively normal with markets open and people in the streets In addition to the indigenous population of Mosul there are believed to be several hundred thousand Sunni Arabs many of them Isis supporters who fled there from Iraqi provinces such as Anbar Diyala and Salahudin where Isis has already been defeated (Reprinted from The Independent by permission of author or representative \n",

The more USA accessible mineral waters with similar levels of silicic acid to Spritzer which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier are Volvic and Fiji My personal favorite is Fiji because it has the highest level of ionic suspended silica as silicic acid and is the least expensive I’ve seen it in WalMart at $1.99 per liter Also People’s Chemist Shane Ellison analyzed various water bottles and said Fiji water bottles are free of BPA and its chemical cousins Others he rates highly as BPA free are Voss Evian and Smart Water The suggested protocol is at least five days consuming a 1.5 liter bottle of water daily More is required for high levels of aluminum toxicity Dr Exley considers drinking the whole bottle within an hour as the most efficient method of detoxing aluminum from the brain Dr Exley explains that there are three commercial bottled waters listing silica amounts as milligrams (mg per liter on the bottle Fiji has the highest amount of the three Neither of us is affiliated with Fiji Silica mineral waters can be supplemented to help prevent dementia Obviously it can also be used as an adjunct with pure cold pressed coconut oil to stop early onset Alzheimer’s or even reverse most of the symptoms after AD symptoms appear More on coconut oil for Alzheimer’s can be found here Aluminum (Al is passed out through the urine when one supplements silica sufficiently It seems there’s little danger of taking too much as long as adequate water is consumed and vitamin B1 and potassium levels are maintained More About Silica Silica helps ensure collagen elasticity of all connecting tissues in the body including tendons and cartilage This reduces aches and pains and maintains your body’s flexibility It has also been determined that high levels of blood serum silica keep arterial plaque from building and clogging blood vessels A major culprit for arterial plaque has recently shifted from cholesterol buildup to arterial calcification from serum calcium that is not absorbed as bone matter It’s known that silica is an important part of building bone matter Without sufficient silica magnesium and vitamin K2 calcium doesn’t become part of bone matter and remains in the blood to potentially calcify in the soft tissue of inner artery walls and the heart Silica is vital for keeping strong bones and a healthy cardiovascular system This qualifies silica as an essential anti-aging mineral that is much more than a skin deep beauty mineral Other good sources of silica are the herb horsetail cucumbers and diatomaceous earth powder Although these three other sources are helpful for the recent aforementioned reasons they lack the ionic suspension of silicic acid found in the mineral waters to penetrate the blood-brain barrier I just found these other sources for ionic silica or silicic acid as well here and here Paul Fassa is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com His pet peeves are the Medical Mafia’s control over health and the food industry and government regulatory agencies corruption Paul’s valiant contributions to the health movement and global paradigm shift are world renowned Visit his blog by following this link and follow him on Twitter here \n",

      "Zero Hedge October 28 2016 Moments ago Russian president started speaking at the final session of the Valdai International Discussion Club’s 13th annual meeting in Sochi More than 130 experts and political analysts from Russia and other countries are taking part in this year’s three-day meeting titled ‘The Future in Progress Shaping the World of Tomorrow While Putin’s speech can be seen below he has already had a handful of soundbites most notably the following he just said in response to accusations that Russia could influence the US election Hysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election said Putin calling it a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country’s national debt or gun control It’s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers spies and agents of influence Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people’s choice in any way The number of mythical dreamt-up problems include the hysteria I can’t think of another word that has broken out in the United States about the influence of Russia on the current elections for the US president He ended that phrase as follows What is America a banana republic Putin mocks claim that Russia is trying to influence the US elections What is America a banana republic America is a great power Steve Rosenberg @BBCSteveR) October 27 2016 And then to emphasize his trolling added the following correct me if I am wrong He also said that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone it is ridiculous foolish and unthinkable I read your analytical materials prepared not only by those present but also by analysts in the US and Europe However it is just unthinkable silly and unrealistic In Europe alone the combined population of NATO countries stands at 300 million in the US the total population is probably 600 million while in Russia 146 million It is just funny to talk about this According to the Russian president contradictions stemming from redistribution of political power are growing Regrettably next to nothing has changed for the better in the past months To be frank nothing has changed Contradictions stemming from redistribution of economic power and political influence are only growing Putin said Hence according to the Russian leader the burden of mutual mistrust is limiting possibilities to stand to real challenges and real threats facing the world community As a matter of fact the entire globalization project has turned to be a crisis and voices in Europe are speaking (and we know and hear it well about the failure of the policy of multiculturalism Putin said adding that this situation is a consequence of a wrong hasty and somewhat arrogant choice made by Europe’s political elites some twenty-five years ago Back then at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s there was a chance not only to spur globalization processes but to give them a qualitatively new harmonious and sustainable character the Russian leader said He drew attention to the fact that the countries that claimed to be the winners in the Cold War began to reshape the global political and economic order in their own interests These states in his words embarked on a path of globalization and security for themselves only but not for all But not all agreed on that.Some could not resist that any longer whereas others were not yet ready so no wonder the system of international relations has been feverish and the global economy is failing to recover from the crisis Putin added On globalization The Russian president stressed globalization should be for all but not only for the select few Obviously the global community must focus on really topical problems facing the entire humankind the solution of which will make the world a safer and more stable place and the system of international relations equal and fair Putin said He said such an approach will make it possible to make the globalization for the select few turn into globalization for all I am confident that it is possible to overcome any challenges and threats only together Putin stressed On Global Propaganda The president said he regrets that Moscow does not possess such global propaganda techniques as Washington does I would like to have such a propaganda machine in Russia But unfortunately I don’t We have no such global media as CNN, BBC and some others We have no such opportunities so far Putin said at a session of the Valdai Discussion Club On the world economy The president expects the trend towards regionalization of the world economy will continue It is absolutely evident that economic cooperation must be mutually advantageous and be based on general universal principles so that each state could become a full-fledged participant in the global economic life Putin said In the mid-term prospect the tendency towards regionalization of the global economy will apparently continue but regional trade agreements should complement develop and not substitute universal norms and rules the president said The global economy is unable to get out of the current systemic crisis and the political and economic principles continue to be reshuffled Putin stressed The system of international relations remains feverish The global economy is unable to get out of the systemic crisis The principles and rules in politics and the economy continue to be reshuffled Quite often dogmas that until recently had been regarded as fundamentally true are turned inside out Putin said These days he said whenever the powers that be find some standards or rules beneficial they force everybody else to obey them However if at a certain point the very same standards begin to pose obstructions they are at once sent into the dustbin as outdated and new rules are established As an example of that strategy Putin mentioned the missile and bombing strikes against Belgrade and Iraq then against Libya and Afghanistan The operation began without a corresponding resolution by the UN Security Council Some superpowers the Russian leader said in their attempts to change the strategic balance of force in their favor have torn down the international legal regime that prohibited the deployment of new missile defense systems They have created and armed international terrorist groups whose cruelty is now pushing millions of migrants out of the unsafe areas Whole countries are being plunged into chaos The principles of free trade are trampled on and sanctions are used to exert political pressures We can see the freedom of trade being sacrificed and so-called sanctions being used for exerting political pressures In bypass of the World Trade Organizations attempts are being made to form closed economic alliances living by harsh rules and putting up firm barriers alliances where dome On NATO He said that NATO has outlived its usefulness as a structure and on the topic of the escalating proxy war in Syria Putin had a simple comment Our agreements with the US on Syria did not work out And some more headlines

      "Canada and EU sign ‘thoroughly undemocratic CETA trade deal Opposition groups note that the deal could still fail legal scrutiny and ratification in Europe By Nadia Prupis Canada and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on Sunday amid widespread protests against the controversial deal that came back to life after negotiations stalled over objections from Wallonia Belgium Environmental and democracy groups who opposed the agreement issued cautious statements condemning the signing but noting that CETA was not a done deal This agreement will probably not survive the democratic and legal scrutiny of the ratification process over the coming months It’s time for our governments to break rank with corporate lobbyists and redesign a trade policy that respects democracy and promotes the public interest said Shira Stanton trade policy adviser at Greenpeace EU. CETA now faces a vote in the European Parliament and ratification by the parliaments of the EU’s 28 countries If it passes CETA would create a legal system that allows corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profit That framework will also be put to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice and the German constitutional court and if it fails to stand up would invalidate CETA. The deal has long been opposed on the grounds that it would harm human rights democracy and the climate among other risks Alfred de Zayas the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order said in a statement Saturday that each country should hold a referendum on signing the deal before doing so warning that it was a corporate-driven fundamentally flawed treaty There is a legitimate fear that CETA will dilute environmental standards food security and health and labor protection he said A treaty that strengthens the position of investors transnational corporations and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats Global Justice Now (GJN) trade and migration campaigner Guido Tallman tweeted a picture of the massive deal and wrote Here’s CETA. Any MEP planning to vote for it should be sure to read it first All of it So they know what they’re voting for Throughout Europe this weekend CETA opponents took to the streets to protest the signing In London on Saturday many posed outside the European Commission office dressed as zombies to symbolize CETA’s seeming resurrection urging commissioners to stop CETA rising from the dead In Brussels some protesters broke through a barricade and attempted to storm the European Commission building before being dragged away by police GJN executive director Nick Dearden said Saturday The signing ceremony means that CETA has been brought back from the dead for now—but it is a ticking time bomb The Wallonia parliament has a promise that they will be able to stop the ratification of CETA when they get a formal vote on it and unless there are substantial changes they—and hopefully other parliaments—will use that veto CETA would open up our government to a deluge of court cases by North American multinational corporations and investors Dearden continued It presents a threat to our ability to protect the environment to protect the public and to limit the power of big banks It’s thoroughly undemocratic and must be stopped This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License Nadia Prupis is a Common Dreams staff writer Special Reports Bookmark the permalink \n",

      " ANTIWAR Complaining about Western hysteria surrounding repeated predictions of Russian military attacks on NATO member nations Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to resolve two solid years of predictions to that effect with a straightforward assurance that Russia is not going to attack anyone Putin accused Western nations of having mythical dreamt-up problems and insisted the idea that Russia was going to attack the West was simply stupid and unrealistic He added that he believes the idea is being played up to justify bigger military spending The Russian president also sought to dismiss allegations that he is plotting to rig the US elections to his own benefit noting that the US is a great power and not some banana republic with an easily manipulated political system Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border with ever-growing numbers announced all the time Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that country’s east with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries \n",

      "The unraveling of Hillary's corrupt sphere of influence November 4 2016 Michael Cutler The 2016 elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from FBI Director James Comey on Friday October 28 2016 as reported by NBC News on October 30 th FBI Obtains Warrant for Newly Discovered Emails in Clinton Probe as Reid Accuses Comey of Hatch Act Violation Once again the Clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional Indeed Tom Clancy could not have scripted this year's presidential election and intrigues While Comey's recent remarks regarding the Clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how Hillary's use of a private computer server private e-mail account and non-secure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception The current focus of the Clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by Weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information If that laptop had been hacked both Weiner and Abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail This was an issue raised by Congressman Louie Gohmert Texan Republican and former judge in a Fox News Business interview on October 31 2016 in a segment that was posted under the title Rep Gohmert Clinton is a potential victim of blackmail Additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these e-mails as well A chain is as strong as its weakest link The weak links begin with Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin and may now include Anthony Weiner and perhaps others Meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that WikiLeaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the Clintons or their foundation Could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well Let's take a moment to understand how all of this began Just months earlier Hillary Clinton had been let off the hook by an FBI Director who in his official statement on July 5 2016 included this excerpt To be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences To the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions But that is not what we are deciding now By Comey's own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently This raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why Comey did not see fit to take comparable action with Ms Clinton Comey's ultimate decision to not present the case to a Grand Jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security However perhaps Comey's hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch less than one week before the FBI Director conducted that press conference On June 29 2015 ABC News-15 reported US Attorney General Loretta Lynch Bill Clinton meet privately in Phoenix before Benghazi report That article served as a predication for my article Loretta Lynch's Private Meeting With Bill Clinton Prior to Release of Benghazi Report Why would the Attorney General who sets the tone for law enforcement do this As Attorney General Lynch is FBI Director Comey's boss At the time of this meeting the Justice Department was not only investigating Hillary's illegal use of a private e-mail server non-secure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation In fact on October 30 2016 Breitbart reported Clinton Foundation FBI Investigation Confirmed By Former Assistant FBI Director Therefore Bill Clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the Attorney General to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren However just days after that meeting news organizations reported that Hillary was contemplating keeping Lynch on as Attorney General if she won the election On July 4 2016 Newsmax reported NY Times Clinton Weighs Keeping Lynch as Attorney General if She Wins Hillary's statement that she might keep Lynch on as Attorney General could have provided the incentive for Lynch to Go along to get along Indeed Lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as I described in my commentary Loretta Lynch Same as the Old Boss The Attorney General nominee's disturbing views on U.S. immigration law My article included an excerpt from a Yahoo/AP news report Attorney General nominee defends Obama immigration changes Here is the exchange in which Lynch discussed the administration's immigration's policies Lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration She said the Homeland Security Department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us Pressed by Sen Jeff Sessions of Alabama a leading immigration hard-liner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned However when Sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job Lynch replied The right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here Sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response Under later questioning by Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer of New York Lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status This was disturbing and telling clearly Ms Lynch's views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals As Attorney General Lynch directs the operations of the entire Justice Department and all those who work for that department Ms Lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective However Lynch and the others who have fallen under Hillary Clinton's corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in Hillary's web of deception having fallen victim to the Hillary Virus Throughout Clinton's many decades in American politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable It is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election \n",

      "Written by Robert Parry If Hillary Clinton hangs on to win the presidency liberal Democrats have vowed to block her appointment of Wall Street-friendly officials to key Cabinet and sub-Cabinet jobs But there has been little organized resistance to her choosing hawkish foreign policy advisers Indeed Washington’s foreign policy establishment has purged almost anyone who isn’t part of the neoconservative/liberal-interventionist group think That’s why pretty much everyone who matters agrees about the need to push around Russia China Syria Iran etc Reflecting that attitude Sunday’s lead editorial in the neocon Washington Post hailed the broad consensus within the Establishment for more warlike actions once President Obama is gone taking with him what the Post calls Obama’s self-defeating passivity The Post praised a new report from the liberal Center for American Progress which calls for bombing the Syrian military and getting tough to counter Iran’s negative influence in line with what all the neocons as well as Israel and Saudi Arabia want the next President to do The absence of any significant counter to this neocon/liberal-hawk group think represents one of the greatest dangers to the future of the human species since this new hubris comes with a cavalier assumption that nuclear-armed Russia and China will simply accept humiliation dished out by the indispensable nation If they don’t we can expect Official Washington to ratchet up tensions in a game of nuclear chicken with the expectation that the leaders in Moscow and Beijing will bow down to US exceptionalism and slink away with their tails between their legs Surely that is what the armchair warriors at The Washington Post will demand and they have of course a spotless record of infallibility such as their certainty that Iraq was hiding stockpiles of WMD in 2003 Editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt was so sure of that he wrote it as flat fact Given the Iraq War catastrophe and the failure to find the WMD, you might have assumed that Hiatt was summarily fired and has never worked in journalism again But of course you’d be wrong He is still the editorial-page editor of The Washington Post continuing to ladle out his extraordinary wisdom and brilliant insights The New McCarthyism And if you dare question those new certainties or note the risks of stumbling into a nuclear conflagration the Post’s editorial pages label you a Moscow stooge repeating Russian propaganda That is what Post columnist Anne Applebaum wrote about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump when he warned about the risks of World War III if a President Hillary Clinton starts shooting down Russian planes over Syria Rather than acknowledge the genuine risk of getting into a shooting war with Russia neocon Applebaum declares such concerns unacceptable and offers a whiff of McCarthyism toward anyone who thinks such a thing Why is Russian state media using such extreme language she asks darkly And why is Trump repeating it Then with the typical perceptiveness of a neocon ideologue Applebaum determines that the Kremlin is warning its citizens about the growing risks of nuclear war to scare them into line amid a recession that the US helped create as part of its regime change strategy to destabilize Russia by making its economy scream A thoughtful person might stop here and wonder if the use of economic sanctions and other means to destabilize nuclear-armed Russia is such a good idea but no mainstream person is allowed to raise such questions inside Official Washington That would just make you a Russian puppet in Applebaum’s view Applebaum then rants on with some wild conspiracy theories about Russian plans to exploit the US presidential transition Whatever the outcome on Nov 8 political uncertainty will follow the months of transition a change of White House staff perhaps even the violent backlash that Trump may incite This could be an excellent moment for a major Russian offensive a land grab in Ukraine a foray into the Baltic states a much bigger intervention in the Middle East anything to ‘test the new president If that’s coming Putin needs to prepare his public to fight much bigger wars and to persuade the rest of the world not to stop him He needs to get his generals into the right mind-set and his soldiers ready to go A little nuclear war rhetoric never fails to focus attention and I’m sure it has Reckless Drivel Perhaps the more immediate question here is why a major American newspaper runs such crazy and reckless drivel from one of its regular columnists But the fact that the Post does so indicates how dangerous the moment is for humanity For those of us who read the Post regularly such insane rhetoric barely registers since we see similar nuttiness on a daily basis But the group think that the Post and other mainstream publications create and then enforce explains why there is such unity among the Establishment as it presses ahead with these dangerous policies in much the same manner that almost the same cast of insiders group thought their way into the disastrous Iraq War So the wannabe insiders at the Center for American Progress and the more established pooh-bahs at the Brookings Institution and other preeminent think tanks know they have to promote regime change strategies and other forms of warmongering to appease Hiatt and his fellow neocon editorialists and columnists In Washington this group think has moved beyond the usual careerist and conformist conventional wisdom into something more akin to totalitarianism at least on foreign policy issues That is why it is hard to even come up with a list of sensible people who could survive the onslaught of character assassinations if they were to be proposed as senior advisers to a President Hillary Clinton That is also why the attention of progressives such as Sens Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren only on vetting domestic officials in a prospective Hillary Clinton administration is so insufficient If a hawkish President Clinton surrounds herself with like-minded neocons and liberal hawks the costs of their warmongering would surely swallow up the tax dollars necessary for domestic priorities on infrastructure education health care the environment and other pressing concerns And if the McCarthyistic intolerance of The Washington Post influences or infects her administration the genuine risks of World War III will dwarf any other worries Reprinted with permission from ConsortiumNews.com Related\n",

      "The Newspaper For academics at the University of Maryland (UMD) merely collecting a toll from drivers for every mile they drive is not enough UMD College Park researchers Di Yang Eirini Kastrouni and Lei Zhang insist in a recent academic paper that motorists should pay a proportionally higher tax that is based on their income Published in the journal Transport Policy the article argues that a new variable-rate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax could supplement transportation funds being rapidly depleted by increased spending on transit infrastructure On the revenue generation side VMT fee policies can supplement the existing fuel tax revenues to mitigate the fiscal deficit the researchers wrote for the London School of Economics last week The three income-based VMT fees are all designed to double the revenue generated so that they are comparable with respect to their impacts on consumer surplus and travel behavior Currently gasoline taxes at the state and federal level are collected primarily at the distributor level which keeps the tax simple The more one drives the more one pays with those choosing lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles spending less at the pump Many politicians hate the gas tax because the public generally opposes hikes in fuel taxes As a result transportation officials have sought more indirect means of taxation that would make it easier to raise rates The VMT has emerged as a popular solution in transportation circles but opponents have objected that vehicle miles traveled taxes hit low-income drivers the hardest The researchers suggest the solution is to raise more money for transit while simultaneously eliminating the fairness concern by imposing higher VMT taxes on drivers from high-income households Among the proposed fee structures the policy with a fixed interval increase rate as people’s level of income improves is considered to be progressive overall the researchers explain A ten cent per mile VMT tax would generate $44 billion nationwide over twenty years The latest article is based on an analysis in Yang’s 2014 master’s thesis which calculated the impact of the fees using various economic and travel demand models One model for instance would have the tax jump 50 percent at each income bracket So a 10-cent-per mile rate for households earning less than $20,000 per year would rise to 15 cents up to the $20,000 to $40,000 per year bracket From $40,000 to $60,000 the rate would be 23 cents from $60,000 to $100,000 it would be 34 cents and above $100,000 it would be 51 cents As most drivers travel 12,000 miles per year the low income tax would be $1200 compared to $6120 for the wealthy At this rate Yang calculates that the income-adjusted vehicle miles traveled tax would more than double the gas tax revenue compared to the 57 percent increase a flat-rate VMT would generate The paper presumes drivers facing a doubling of government fees would be more inclined to take the bus \n",

      "Videos Jill Stein Blasts ‘Attack-Dog Media Clinton Protectionists After Daily Beast Smear The Green Party presidential candidate questioned the lack of ‘disclosure on the conflict of interest posed by Chelsea Clinton's position as a director of the corporate owner of the Daily Beast IAC’ after The Daily Beast published an article criticizing Stein’s investments October 31 2016 Be Sociable Share Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein delivers a stump speech to her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland Calif on Thursday Oct 6 2016 AUSTIN, Texas Green Party presidential candidate Dr Jill Stein accused The Daily Beast a popular news and opinion website of hiding its ties to the Clintons after publishing an attack on Stein’s investment portfolio on Wednesday Jill Stein’s Ideology Says One Thing—Her Investment Portfolio Says Another declared the headline for an analysis of Stein’s investments and finances by Yashar Ali The article suggests that Stein has millions of dollars invested in mutual funds which support industries she opposes on the campaign trail including fossil fuels and the military-industrial complex If Mr Ali is truly interested in conflicts of interest of political candidates and their families where is his disclosure on the conflict of interest posed by Chelsea Clinton’s position as a director of the corporate owner of the Daily Beast IAC Stein fired back in a detailed response sent to the Daily Beast prior to publication and published to her campaign website in full on Wednesday Dr Jill Stein @DrJillStein October 27 2016 Ali’s analysis was based on Stein’s financial disclosure filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics a requirement for all presidential candidates which the office published in March Ali also used Stein’s 2015 tax return which the candidate released voluntarily earlier this year Ali reported that Stein and her husband Richard Rohrer have investments (with the exception of real estate valued at anywhere from $3,832,050 to $8,505,000 then criticized the candidate for her investment in a series of index funds or mutual funds which offer investors relatively safe and consistent returns on their money However in exchange for reliable earnings investors also give up control over where their money is used Like many Americans who hold retirement accounts pension funds or who invest in the American economy my finances are largely held in index funds or mutual funds over which I have no control in management or decision-making Stein wrote in her response She added Over the years I have taken steps to divest from the worst of these holdings transferring my checking and savings accounts from Bank of America largely to a credit union and divesting from GE, Dupont and Merck stocks I had been given decades ago While green mutual funds exist Stein noted that many of these funds actually invest in fracking and biofuels making them not much better than the non-green funds She continued I have not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people planet and peace Admittedly I have not spent a lot of time researching elusive ethical investments I prefer using my time fighting for social economic and ecological transformation and recycling capitalist money into the fight to do so She also wrote that she inherited over a half-million dollars from her parents and that she’s used her investments and capital to help build the social and political movements needed for transformative change Ali’s article was designed to distract voters from larger issues of corruption within the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party she suggested She elaborated He has created an imagined conflict of interest perhaps to distract from the very real harmful conflicts of interest in the Clintons pay-to-play schemes back-room fundraising and quarter-million dollar speeches for the predatory banks health insurance industry and fossil fuel tycoons who have directly benefited from Hillary Clinton’s policy record as Senator and Secretary of State as well as from Bill Clinton’s actions as President In October Forbes staff writer Dan Alexander estimated that Bill and Hillary Clinton were worth about $45 million though he noted that their tax returns and financial disclosure filings left millions in earnings unaccounted for In February CNN reported that the Clintons earned $153 million in speaking fees between 2001 and the spring 2015 launch of Hillary Clinton’s latest presidential campaign Under Stein’s Green New Deal platform the United States would transition away from foreign wars and fossil fuels by investing heavily in renewable energy In addition to its ties to Chelsea Clinton The Daily Beast’s editor Michael Weiss has been criticized for supporting neoconservative U.S. foreign policy including military intervention and empire building In August Richard Silverstein writing for alternative media analysis site The Unz Review noted that Weiss is frequently tapped to advocate for war on TV news programs He wrote Weiss age 36 has been an itinerant freelance journalist and military interventionist gun-for-hire plying his trade from Washington DC, to London to the outlying lands of former Russian empire to the ruins of Syria With his role as CNN commentator and senior editor at the Daily Beast he is a leading light among a new young generation of neoconservative intellectuals In April 2015 Stein told MintPress News that the media deliberately marginalizes third-party voices in order to keep voters from being fully informed about all their choices She told Carmen Russell-Sluchansky It illustrates what they are terrified of If people learn that they have an option that reflects what they want they will vote for it Half the population doesn’t vote because they don’t like what they see as their options \n",

Christian Adams Via PJ Media Leaked funding documents reveal an effort by George Soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported The billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures push public narratives about voter fraud and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats These Soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501(c (3 and (c (4 charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups government officials and purportedly non-partisan groups like the League of Women Voters The leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times Conservatives and Republicans have no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Soros-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents The documents reveal that the Soros campaign fueled litigation attacking election integrity measures such as citizenship verification and voter ID. It funded long-term efforts to fundamentally transform election administration including the creation of databases that were marketed to state governments for use in voter verification It propped up left-leaning media to attack reports of voter fraud and conducted racially and ideologically targeted voter registration drives The racially targeted voter registration drives were executed at the same time Soros dollars were funding other public relations efforts to polarize racial minority groups by scaring them about the loss of voting rights and the dangers of police officers The Soros documents reveal hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into the effort to transform the legal and media environment touching on elections One document notes that poverty-alleviation programs are being de-emphasized for this new effort It states George Soros has authorized U.S. Programs to propose a budget of $320 million over two years with the understanding that the annual budget for U.S. Programs will be $150 million beginning in 2013 The purpose of the expansion is clear The increase in Democracy and Power Fund budget will expand funding of non-partisan voter engagement to catalyze participation from African-American Latino immigrant and youth communities in particular and to ensure a fair and just redistricting process The increase in the Transparency and Integrity Fund will expand support for election reform judicial independence and journalism Below are some highlights of this expansive Soros-funded campaign to alter the legal environment and rules of American elections Read more -documents-reveal-expansive-soros-funding-to-manipulate-federal-elections The post Leaked Documents Reveal Expansive Soros Funding to Manipulate Federal Elections appeared first on We Are Change \n",

      "Written by John Pilger Saturday October 29 2016 American journalist Edward Bernays is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda The nephew of Sigmund Freud the pioneer of psychoanalysis it was Bernays who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions In 1929 as a publicist for the cigarette industry Bernays persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade behavior then considered outlandish One feminist Ruth Booth declared Women Light another torch of freedom Fight another sex taboo Bernays’s influence extended far beyond advertising His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War The secret he said was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment [them according to our will without their knowing about it He described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government Today the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood In my career as a journalist and filmmaker I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged Tale of Two Cities Imagine two cities Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country Both cities are occupied by fanatics who commit terrible atrocities such as beheading people But there is a vital difference In one siege the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes There are front-page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory There is scant mention of civilian casualties In the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics The difference is that these fanatics are supported supplied and armed by us by the United States and Britain They even have a media center that is funded by Britain and America Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city Confusing Not really Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda I am referring of course to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria backed by Russia One is good the other is bad Behind the Fanatics What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003 That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news the monstrous ISIS and Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that British Prime Minister Tony Blair was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the century the invasion of Iraq The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush Fox News brought on former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to effuse over then-Secretary of State Colin Powell’s fabrications The same year soon after the invasion I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis the renowned American investigative journalist I asked him What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda He replied that if journalists had done their job there is a very very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq It was a shocking statement and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous In other words had journalists done their job had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it hundreds of thousands of men women and children would be alive today and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on July 7 2005 There would have been no flight of millions of refugees there would be no miserable camps When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria and more terrorism followed predictably the product of Hollande’s bombast about France being at war and showing no mercy That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak When the truth is replaced by silence said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko the silence is a lie Punishing Independence The attack on Iraq the attack on Libya the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an agreement that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy His people were bombed and he was prosecuted in The Hague Independence of this kind is intolerable As WikLeaks has revealed it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline running through his country from Qatar to Europe that he was attacked From that moment the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage Why is this not news The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq told me We would feed journalists factoids of sanitized intelligence or we would freeze them out That is how it worked The West’s medieval client Saudi Arabia to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars worth of arms is at present destroying Yemen a country so poor that in the best of times half the children are malnourished Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs our bombs that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages and against weddings and funerals The explosions look like small atomic bombs The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers This fact is not on the evening news Refined Messengers Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education Oxford Cambridge Harvard Columbia and with careers on the BBC, the Guardian the New York Times the Washington Post These organizations are known as the liberal media They present themselves as enlightened progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist They are anti-racist pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. And they love war While they speak up for feminism they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women including the right to life In 2011 Libya then a modern state was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people That was the incessant news and there was no evidence It was a lie In fact Britain Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call regime change in Libya the biggest oil producer in Africa Gaddafi’s influence in the continent and above all his independence were intolerable So Gaddafi was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics backed by America Britain and France Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera declaring We came we saw he died The destruction of Libya was a media triumph As the war drums were beaten Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian Though the risks are very real the case for intervention remains strong Intervention what a polite benign Guardian word whose real meaning for Libya was death and destruction According to its own records NATO launched 9,700 strike sorties against Libya of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets They included missiles with uranium warheads Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross The Unicef report on the children killed says most [of them under the age of ten As a direct consequence Sirte became a capital of ISIS. Ukraine is another media triumph Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times the Washington Post and the Guardian and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous Cold War All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when in fact the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States aided by Germany and NATO. Inversion of Reality This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington’s military intimidation of Russia is not news it is suppressed behind a smear-and-scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first Cold War Once again the Russkies are coming to get us led by another Stalin whom The Economist depicts as the devil The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine except Vladimir Putin but he does not count Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country as agents of Moscow almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government There is almost the joie d’esprit of a class reunion of warmongers The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction Excerpt reprinted with permission from RT Selling ‘Regime Change Wars to the Masses Related\n",

an all-payer model statewide In a statement sent from the governor’s office Shumlin thanked President Barack Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell for negotiating the agreement with the state and he said the model would control health care costs and reward doctors for a more preventive approach to care Vermont will now become the first state in America to ensure that your doctor can focus on keeping you healthy rather than running tests or procedures Shumlin said adding By shifting the focus away from the current fee-for-service system to one that rewards primary care and prevention we will help Vermonters lead healthier lives and more effectively manage chronic diseases allow doctors to better treat their patients and identify health issues before they become severe and reduce costs in a health care system that if left unchecked will bankrupt our state and Vermont families Green Mountain Care Board Chair Al Gobeille called the event an important next step in provider-led health care reform adding that the program will save Vermont $10 billion over the next decade However the board’s action did little to address concerns raised by the Joint Fiscal Office In a report released Friday the JFO weighed the supposed benefits of the new system against a list of critiques and uncertainties Among the uncertainties are the administrative costs of the program as well as where funding will come from The JFO report also notes that the next governor could refuse to go forward with the program Republican gubernatorial candidate Phil Scott has said he does not support the program In a statement sent to local media State House Minority Leader Rep Don Turner criticized the plan The proposal raises many important but unanswered questions regarding the ability to cap healthcare cost growth the use of the ACO model and the competency of the Shumlin Administration to successfully run another complex regulatory system given its dismal record with Vermont Health Connect he said Darcie Johnston director of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom said she was shocked at the speed with which the board approved the draft Our legislators made a huge mistake in giving the GMCB so much power the power to enter into contracts to further destroy our health care system Amy Cooper executive director of HealthFirst an independent practice association representing over 250 medical professionals told Vermont Watchdog she believes the concept could be a good one but nevertheless is nervous about the State’s ability to implement it especially with such a short timeline of reviewing the details that were only released a month ago Shumlin will sign the revised draft document at 2 p.m Thursday in his ceremonial office in Montpelier Over the past month health care officials held public forums to explain Vermont’s 44-page draft agreement with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Still many doctors and patients feel unsure of what the all-payer model will mean for them in part because of the program’s many complexities For starters despite the administration’s talk of an all-payer waiver the draft document contains a waiver only for Medicare not Medicaid or commercial insurance the other two payers in Vermont’s health care system Instead the document gives state health care officials permission to operate accountable care organizations or ACOs under a restructured payment system For health care providers the new payment system will start to replace current fee-for-service payments with a state-run global budget the goal of which is to reward positive outcomes and overall population health Once the agreement is finalized Vermont will start using its state-approved ACO, called the Vermont Care Organization That network of health care providers is comprised of representatives from existing ACOs including OneCare HealthFirst and Community Health Accountable Care The smaller ACOs have not yet committed to being managed by the Vermont Care Organization They have until 2018 to decide whether to remain as fee-for-service operators or transition to global budgeting within the Vermont Care Organization as overseen by the Green Mountain Care Board Dr Paul Reiss chief medical officer at HealthFirst told Watchdog his ACO is not recommending that physicians sign on with the Vermont Care Organization until details of the offer are known There’s no proposal to change the way physicians are paid under Medicare in 2017 Reiss said We’ll recommend signing on when there are actually offers on the table At recent public forums both Gov Peter Shumlin and Al Gobeille chair of the Green Mountain Care Board said the Vermont Care Organization would be risk bearing That means the umbrella ACO network not individual providers will absorb losses if providers exceed their budget for the year While the risk-bearing stipulation may allay providers worries about going over budget page 8 of the agreement states that the ACO is responsible for at minimum 30 percent of shared losses Put another way providers in some cases will be responsible for paying up to 70 percent of the cost of exceeding the state-determined budget Delivering care under a global budget worries some doctors who may not be able to survive under a budget cap and offer effective care at the same time When an audience member at the Norwich public forum asked what impact failing practices might have on the system Shumlin replied You cannot be refused care It’s the ACO’s problem to deal with the bankruptcy It would not affect care in any way It might not be the same provider because they would be out of business theoretically but someone would have an interest in caring for you Gobeille agreed that private practices might face bankruptcy because they couldn’t make it work in the independent practice world He added that such practices could be absorbed into the hospital system Since the draft agreement was announced some physicians have criticized the plan on the grounds that hospitals may continue getting reimbursed for services at a higher rate because of their bargaining advantage with insurance companies and the Green Mountain Care Board While it’s generally expected that the all-payer model will fix the payment reimbursement differential between Medicare Medicaid and commercial insurers Reiss said he’s skeptical There are no [plans currently diagrammed on any drawing board to make that happen Reiss told Watchdog In fact the draft agreement doesn’t fix the reimbursement differential Instead it says by 2020 the state must deliver a report on options to narrow the Payer Differential between payers The long delay could disappoint independent physicians who have been told they don’t have to join the state-run ACO if they don’t want That freedom of choice may be illusory at best since financial pressure cited in the agreement could coerce doctors to join the network or face financial consequences Specifically the draft agreement says the state will encourage providers and beneficiaries to participate One encouragement includes a potential Medicare payment reduction for practices that remain outside of the ACO. However in an Oct.19 email exchange obtained by Vermont Watchdog state Sen Tim Ashe told Burlington psychiatrist Robert Emmons that he contacted Ena Backus health policy chief at the Green Mountain Care Board and the financial penalty is now removed from the updated agreement Funding to help Vermont abandon a fee-for-service model includes a one-time payment of $9.5 million dollars from Medicare The state also has a verbal agreement with Medicaid for $200 million likely $110 million in federal money and $90 million in state funds It’s unclear where this money and the administrative expense of Vermont Care Organization will come from On Tuesday Johnston unsuccessfully called for the board to delay its vote until outstanding questions are answered We believe that doctors and patients have significant concerns and that the delivery of health care to Vermonters could be significantly impacted We are concerned about the rationing of care the Vermonters for Healthcare Freedom director said in a statement …There are too many questions that deserve answers before the Green Mountain Care Board should agree to support such a risky venture Other concerns of Johnston’s include a lack of transparency and the model’s impact on Vermont’s doctor shortage A timeline of key events reveals the long road ahead for the all-payer health care model \n",

      " Nicolas Nova CC 2.0 Editor’s Note Tom Hayden an activist author and longtime Truthdig contributor died Sunday at age 76 In his memory Truthdig will share one of Hayden’s pieces each day this week This story was originally posted on April 9 2006 Author and political activist Tom Hayden speaks at length about his politics the war in Iraq Cuba-U.S. relations and a range of other topics with Cuban journalists in an interview for Juventud Rebelde The English translation of the interview is published here in full courtesy of Hayden During the past five years the American people have seen vivid pictures of American soldiers torturing prisoners We now have evidence that the Bush administration is engaged in a massive domestic surveillance program without judicial or congressional approval that targets American citizens President Bush ordered American soldiers to war over nonexistent weapons of mass destruction The Bush administration and FEMA failed the people of New Orleans during the Hurricane Katrina disaster Can you explain why the Bush administration seems immune from the political fallout that ordinarily results from such scandals Why is there is no serious move to impeach the president for any or all of these scandals Advertisement Square Site wide I do not wish to sound like an apologist but the Bush administration is not immune Legally the cases against Libby and Abramoff and DeLay are slow-moving bad news for Bush Politically the Bush poll ratings are below the 40 range Republican candidates for Congress are in trouble even though their congressional districts are designed to protect their power As to impeachment something like half of Americans favor impeachment or censure If the Democrats win back the House this November Rep John Conyers will chair the Judiciary Committee and introduce impeachment In general American politics is still suffering from the stolen election of 2000 the chilling effects of 9/11 and the fabricated and unjustified invasion of iraq Can you explain why the level of protests in the U.S. against the war in Iraq is not as notable as during the war in Vietnam The difference is that during Vietnam there was a military draft and the number of casualties was far far higher Relatively speaking therefore the level of protests today is greater—200,000 in October 2002 in D.C. 1 million in February 2003 500,000 in New York in 2004 300,000 in D.C. in 2005 The reformist presidential campaign of Howard Dean was larger than the antiwar Eugene McCarthy campaign of 1968 A majority of Americans including a majority of U.S. soldiers want a troop withdrawal within this year The notable difference I believe is that there was a broader radical movement around the world certainly in 1968 than there is today That makes the antiwar movement here and globally a surprising development it seems to me Do you envision an exit strategy for the U.S. in Iraq in the foreseeable future There is an exit strategy available with some support even within the Pentagon but it is unlikely that Bush will adopt it The strategy would consist of a U.S. announcement of withdrawal a cease-fire by the Iraqi resistance during the withdrawal an international peacekeeping force composed of countries not involved in the occupation a transitional coalition in Baghdad new elections under international auspices a peacetime reconstruction and reparations from the U.S. And UK. Bush may and I emphasize may begin withdrawing tens of thousands of U.S. troops this year in order to pacify antiwar sentiment neutralize Democrats and keep control of the House of Representatives One faction in the Pentagon calls this the Philippines option —have your client government invite you to withdraw so that it is perceived as a victory Recent trends in Latin America make it appear that it is no longer an American backyard Venezuela Bolivia Argentina Uruguay are some of the countries that are taking an independent path to political and economic development It would appear that with the expected election of Lopez Obrador Mexico may soon join that list What can we expect from the Bush administration with respect to Latin America in the coming months I have traveled extensively in Latin America since 2000 and it is a place of exciting and dramatic developments as you know I think progressives across our boundaries should propose a new U.S. Latin American policy beyond the Monroe Doctrine We in the U.S. also must invigorate solidarity movements like those towards Central America and Cuba in past decades It is a dangerous period because of the Bush administration Towards Cuba their malign intentions are well known Towards Venezuela they are defining a new security threat of radical populism and seeking ways to destabilize the democratically elected government Even assassination of Hugo Chavez is an option that some are considering On the trade front the Bush team will try to divide Latin American countries through bilateral trade agreements In the Andes they will continue to send U.S. troops under the cover of the war on drugs We note that you have always been an enemy of the so-called Free Trade Agreement that was so soundly defeated at the presidential summit in Argentina Is that agreement dead and buried Can you comment on the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas known as ALBA? Latin America along with U.S. social movements has defeated the so-called Free Trade Agreement of the Americas for the foreseeable future The World Trade Organization is far from defeated partly because of internal differences among Latin American countries I believe the Bolivarian Alternative is an extremely important counterforce against the U.S. imperial design Mercosur also is a welcome development A united front among the new nationalist governments of Latin America is to be hoped for Venezuela has recently been supplying heating oil at low cost for lower-income people in certain U.S. cities yet some Republican congressmen have been critical of this gesture Please comment In general the response to the Venezuelan initiative has been positive or neutral Objections by some members of Congress is to be expected because they want to prevent any U.S. acceptance of the Chavez government The man many call the Osama bin Laden of Latin America Luis Posada Carriles is in the United States He is wanted in Venezuela for 73 counts of first-degree murder in the downing of a civilian passenger plane in 1976 yet the Bush administration refuses to send him to Venezuela How does that square with President Bushs so-called war on terror Of course it is a contradiction Unfortunately there is little media attention to the issue up here But the issue is a definite complication for the Bush administration’s efforts to improve its status in Latin America You were one of the Chicago 7 that Leonard Weinglass defended in 1968 Now Mr Weinglass is one of the lead lawyers in the case of the Cuban Five Do you think that anyone sympathetic to the Cuban revolution can get a fair trial in Miami I have read the materials concerning the case and believe it is a great untold story here Of course Leonard Weinglass is one of our greatest defense lawyers and is working constantly to generate political and media interest in the Cuban Five No a Cuban revolutionary cannot get a fair trial in Miami But I believe the grip of the anti-Castro Cubans over Latin American policy has been weakened severely by events in Latin America and the recent growth of a vast Latino and immigrant movement in the United States The Bush administration recently tightened travel restrictions for Americans wishing to travel to Cuba Do Americans have a constitutional right to travel They always have and always will Bush is imposing a frustration on all of us apparently to placate his Cuban allies in Miami How will history judge the Bush administration How does President Bush compare to other U.S. presidents in recent history Who knows but I think Bush will be marked with illegitimacy for the stolen election of 2000 fabrication and failure in Iraq corruption and unconstitutional spying at home Perhaps he will face impeachment perhaps not Certainly he is going through his Watergate moment today It is important to speak of the system however not simply Bush Since the disappearance of the Soviet Union the U.S. has attempted to be the sole superpower in a so-called unipolar world But its efforts towards military and economic empire have faltered and will be in a sense re-negotiated As Hugo Chavez and others have argued the reality is that we live in a multipolar world The combination of massive social movements and the multipolarity of power will prevail over any forces seeking to dominate As they say another world is not only possible but is already being created The United States cannot succeed with superpower tactics even on the baseball field I know the horrors of U.S. imperialism in Latin America but I hope that Latin American nationalists will welcome and reach out to the American people especially those in social movements and independent media but also those in political and economic sectors who have no interest in blockades subversion assassination or economic dominance We are here and our numbers are growing especially because of the immigrants who are the harvest of empire [in the words of Juan Gonzales Those who live in the imperial center cannot be expected to come to power any time soon but can restrain and complicate aggression and forge new policies which have the support of a majority of the U.S. people—out of Iraq support for energy alternatives funding for Katrina victims instead of war civil liberties instead of secret tribunals and policing no intervention in Venezuela lifting the blockade on Cuba and so forth Strong support for such measures not only makes imperialism more difficult to sustain but lays the basis for a broad center-left alternative which actually can succeed in the U.S. in the years ahead It has nearly happened here before in the 1930s and ‘40s before the Cold War and again in the 1960s Such moments will come again TAGS:\n",

      "WATCH: Trump Gropes Humiliates Miss Universe Just To Get REVENGE By Karen Shiebler It is absolutely incredible that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is still trying to deny his sexual misconduct First the man brags about grabbing women and kissing them without consent then he acts completely outraged that anyone would ever accuse him of doing just that As a literal parade of women have come forward one after another to accuse the candidate of grabbing them he has responded by threatening to sue them It is hard to believe that anyone would believe Trump’s shallow denials but if there is anyone out there who still needs convincing here you go A video has surfaced from 2011 showing Donald J. Trump publicly humiliating a beauty pageant contestant with sexual jokes at her expense and an unwanted grope in front of thousands of corporate audience members Not only did Trump embarrass the woman and grab her in public he did it out of a very twisted desire for revenge The need for revenge moves Trump’s misogyny out of the realm of the creepy and into the realm of the truly sick Here’s what happened according to reports Trump was speaking to a corporate audience in Sydney Australia in 2011 As he often does in his corporate speeches Trump talked about getting revenge on those who have slighted him He said Get even with people If they screw you screw them back 10 times as hard I really believe that What a prince He went on to give the crowd an example of how he gets even He decided to single out a woman named Jennifer Hawkins She was the 2004 winner of the Miss Universe Pageant which Trump owned He had asked the beauty queen who is Australian to introduce him at the corporate event but there had been some type of miscommunication Either that or she had simply declined to do so Either way Trump was furious at Ms Hawkins He wanted the crowd to see how he handled his anger at a perceived snub As he talked about getting revenge he said I’ll give you an example Jennifer Hawkins Where’s Jennifer Where’s she sitting Get over here Jennifer First of all how beautiful is Jennifer This is about getting even Trump pulled Hawkins up on the stage telling the crowd how angry he had been at her When she tried to explain herself Trump pulled the mic away from her and told the crowd how she had dissed him after he had made her a big star through his pageant He disregarded her attempts to explain instead choosing to make a sexual joke of her So what happens is and you know what She came tonight she came came she came she came When the audience dutifully laughed at Ms Hawkins expense Trump added See so they have the same filthy minds in Australia Oh ha,ha What a sick adolescent mind What an ass It got worse though Trump grabbed the embarrassed woman and pulled her in for a clearly unwanted kiss She managed to get an arm in between them but Trump still managed to kiss her cheek This is all on video folks This is right there for everyone to see The disgusting sexual pervert who wants to be our next President can’t dismiss this one with a threat to sue He can’t pretend that it didn’t happen Because we can all watch it Right here Featured image via YouTube Screengrab About Karen Shiebler Karen is a retired elementary school teacher with many years of progressive activism behind her She is the proud mother of three young adults who were all arrested with Occupy Wall Street To see what she writes about in her spare time check out her blog at Empty Nest Full Life Connect\n",

      " by Claire Bernish Tony Podesta brother of the now-disgraced Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta whose files Wikileaks has been publishing is not only a powerful Democratic Party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of Saudi Arabia No as tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist as it might sound that scenario is the absolute truth In 1988 John and Tony Podesta formed the Podesta Group and have used their bigwig party-insider status to lobby and influence government policies while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest According to the March 2016 filing made in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 Tony Podesta is an active foreign agent of the Saudi government with the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court and acts as an officer of the Saudi Arabia account (click to enlarge At this point the web of pay-for-play between the Washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight For starters the Podesta brothers lobbying firm receives $140,000 every month from the Saudi government which in no uncertain terms and despite a status as privileged U.S. ally wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations John Podesta previously served as President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff founded the think tank Center for American Progress (which oh-so-coincidentally touts the need to reframe Saudi Arabia’s hopelessly tarnished image counseled President Obama and now chairs Hillary Clinton’s campaign Tony Podesta acts as a foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the Kingdom while also contributing to and bundling for Hillary Clinton’s campaign Think about that for a moment One brother uses the influence of money to both affect United States foreign policy and infuse the Clinton campaign with cash while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities As the Washington Post reported months ago in July Tony Podesta’s lobbying efforts raised $268,000 for the campaign and $31,000 for the victory fund The Saudis hired the Podesta Group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in Yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger Raif Badawi to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for ‘insulting Islam Alternet reported Since then Tony Podesta’s fingerprints have been all over Saudi Arabia’s advocacy efforts in Washington DC. When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution Notably the Saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict Additionally Tony Podesta’s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15 2015 ironically revealed by Wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders Hi all we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act are already donating and raising I do want to push back a bit (it’s my job I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general and then DNC and state parties and how do we explain to people that we’ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the Foundation takes from foreign govts but we now won’t Either way we need to make a decision soon To which general counsel to the Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias replied [all errors original and emphasis added Responding to all on this I was not on the call this morning but I lean away from a bright line rule here It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta Canada can’t give but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can Just as we vet lobbyists case by case I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama As the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaign’s image with potentially controversial donors while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash becomes even more apparent As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds Where do we draw the line though Elias suggests a particularly intricate solution If we do it case by case then it will be subjective We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for In judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States its relationship to the State Department during Hillary’s time as Secretary and its relationship if any to the Foundation In judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary’s past campaigns specifically Put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen As a legal matter I am not saying we have to do this we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely I’m just offering this up as a middle ground Mook eventually decides plainly Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything…that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result He convinced me So…in a complete U-turn I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks Are you guys ok with that All of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015 Tony Podesta’s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court which will earn $1.68 million by year’s end does indeed suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine Saudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post That spans both what you’d call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying That broader audience the American public has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis as well As The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign Although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet And yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts The system isn’t rigged it’s performing exactly as intended and always will as long as the vote validates its existence Delivered by The Daily Sheeple We encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos Click for details Contributed by The Free Thought Project of thefreethoughtproject.com The Free Thought Project is dedicated to holding those who claim authority over our lives accountable \n",

      "BAD NEWS: Hillary’s Pimping Past Exposed Dirty Whoring Details Leaked Posted on October 31 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This If Hillary Clinton thought she was in big trouble with the FBI, she’s got another thing coming when she hears what’s just around the corner In fact it seems as though the presidential hopeful’s pimping past was just leaked and every whoring detail is out there for the world to see Hillary is no saint despite what she would have you believe and her apparent pimping past goes to prove just that According to a recent leak it seems that the female presidential wannabe is used to whoring out certain entities so long as she gets to stuff her pockets So who exactly did Hillary force to grab their ankles so that she could rake in millions of dollars Well America more specifically the American working class As explained by The Daily Caller Hillary accepted a whopping $28 million donation to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for 2 favors granted to the country of Morocco Bill Clinton (center right and Hillary Clinton (center left greet Mohammed VI, King of Morocco (right and his sister Lalla Meryem (left Come to find out the first part of the payment came in at $15 million from the country’s King Mohammed VI. Just after that Hillary miraculously got to work on the Mosaic Company America’s largest phosphate mining facility For those unaware phosphates are used in a variety of products but are most well known for being used to make fertilizer for farmers As it turns out one of Morocco’s largest bases for income just so happens to be the selling of phosphates that they illegally rip from their lands In order to put pressure on Mosaic in hopes of shutting them down Hillary deployed the use of both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in an effort to deem the group an environmental threat to our country In order to do so Hillary had the DHS fly planes low over Mosaic’s operations in order to spy on them From there EPA chief Lisa Jackson got to putting the crunch on the organization by making their lives a living hell in every single way Hillary Clinton In the meantime Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to relax U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco thereby allowing the country to expand operations into phosphate mining By the end the American company was to be shut down forcing America to look elsewhere for supply which if you can connect the dots would be where Morocco would come sweeping in Fortunately Florida politicians were able to fight back and put the brakes on before tens of thousands of Americans were negatively influenced by the devious deed However Hillary and the King of Morocco weren’t done there as he pumped another few million into the Clinton Foundation’s account As explained by The Daily Caller An email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton while acting as secretary of state negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech Morocco Hillary also managed to squeeze another $1 million out of the King to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting As one would imagine the recent leak hasn’t made too many people happy and it exposed how Hillary has been whoring out our nation any way she can in order to further fill her own pockets According to Rep Marsha Blackburn a Tennessee Republican these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation Personally I don’t understand why we can’t call this what it is bribery Using fancy terms takes away from the criminal behavior that Hillary has been complicit in Furthermore she has proven that she is perfectly comfortable with illegal behavior as well as pimping out the American people specifically the working class so long as she benefits from it If she did all this in just the short time she was Secretary of State I shudder to think what she will do with the full power of the presidency behind her \n",

      "By Thomas Sowell November 1 2016 The political left keeps announcing as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs that life is unfair Have they never read Thomas Gray’s Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard more than two and a half centuries ago What about economic historian David S. Landes statement The world has never been a level playing field In the joint autobiography of Milton Friedman and his wife Rose they say Everywhere in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth They offend most of us Few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others Moreover Professor Friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life What is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress More important what test of evidence if any have they ever subjected their notions to No one has presented the social vision of the left more often than Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision just don’t get it as he has repeatedly declared Mr Kristof’s essay Growing Up Poor in America in the October 30th New York Times is a classic example of the mindset of the left It begins with the story of a poor black teenager in Arkansas being raised by a single mom Sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book But it does have television sets with huge screens and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana Surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him and that this is a human tragedy The circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances Moreover he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement But that is not enough for Mr Kristof or for the political left in general Of such youngsters he says as a society we fail them long before they fail us Whoa Just when did society make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in And just when did society acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it When the left says society they usually mean government That is apparently what society means in this case for Kristof laments that this teenager is the kind of person whom America’s presidential candidates just don’t talk about If the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies that is their right But if they expect the rest of us to share that belief surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test But we can however The 1960s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to solve what they called social problems How did that workout What were things like before this social vision triumphed And what were things like afterward Homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the 1940s and the 1950s But homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the 1960s wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades When the 1960s began most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father After the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s most black children were born to a single mother like the youngster in Arkansas today When the 1960s began most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father After the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s most black children were born to a single mother like the youngster in Arkansas today Very similar trends occurred in England after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the 1960s Perhaps it is the left that just doesn’t get it or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better The Best of Thomas Sowell Tags Thomas Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University His Web site is www.tsowell.com \n",

      "Region USA in the World Even though The American Spectator has claimed that Obama and his crew will soon be swept into the dustbin of history the future of America’s lame duck still draws a lot of media attention Some commentators especially those that have been handsomely paid by the White House are trying to somehow improve the public image of the still sitting US president who has discredited himself in a number of ways over the last 8 years especially in such fields as combating racism in the United States and Washington’s military interventions across the globe The New York Times would note that with less than three months left for his presidency Barack Obama is preparing for a life after the White House that would most likely include a close relationship with Silicon Valley As an explanation for such a statement the newspaper provides the report on how interested President Obama was in the Dragon spacecraft built by SpaceX. President Obama even tested a program that stimulates docking the spacecraft with the International Space Station This area of Obama’s possible interests is cited by a great many commentators as his future occupation which seems logical since Obama’s contribution to US military contractors regarding profits has been paramount all throughout his years in office However there’s reports that Obama has diverse musical interests as well Reportedly his favorite music genre is soul He listens to various artists that developed this genre but his absolute favorite is Stevie Wonder and his My Cherie Amour All In Love Is Fair For Once in My Life and I Just Called to Say I Love You These songs can always be found in the playlist of the current American leader Barack Obama is also found of Al Green and his vocal prowess He tends to enjoy such saxophonists as Lester Young John Coltrane and Coleman Hawkins As for rock legends Obama prefers to listen to the legendary The Rolling Stones and The Beatles As for the latest hits Barack Obama has been enjoying the Canadian indie rockers Arcade Fire with their We Used to Wait and the British indie-pop band Florence The Machine with their hit You’ve Got The Love As a real American president Barack Obama just can not help but love country music as well as he frequently listens to such bands as Zac Brown and Montgomery Gentry So some musicians especially in the US, have been advising Obama to switch to musical activities perhaps playing in a banjo in a band It seems that it might be a good pastime for Obama after his toying with soldiers in the Middle East and other regions of the world A lot of comments in various media can be found about Obama’s ties with hospitals and Doctors Without Borders in particular Tens of hospital have been wiped off the face of the earth and hundreds of doctors and their patients died as a result of the strikes in Afghanistan Yemen Iraq and elsewhere in the world authorized by Obama Therefore it seems unlikely that any hospital run by Doctors Without Borders will have the courage to turn Obama’s application down after the termination of his presidential mandate Especially when you consider that the risk of dying under US bombs will diminish for most of its employees after January 2017 However if the White House is then occupied by Hillary Clinton Obama may be running the risk of coming under friendly fire if working in one of such hospitals an irony considering his endorsement of Clinton But the most important thing by far is that Obama will no longer be making America’s decisions since during his time doing so he has got the US mired in five overseas wars simultaneously subjecting millions of innocent civilians in the Middle East Africa and Asia to intolerable suffering loss of shelter and families and forced refuge in foreign lands Therefore the choice of a decent successor to the current lame duck president should be way more important than supporting the war party and Obama’s spiritual successor Hillary Clinton Martin Berger is a freelance journalist and geopolitical analyst exclusively for the online magazine New Eastern Outlook Popular Articles \n",

      " If you’re following the news you know FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI found a bunch of emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop As Dilbert Creator Scott Adams notes there appears to be two main observations 1 Comey seemed pro-Clinton when he dropped the initial email case 2 Comey seems anti-Clinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the election So how can both behaviors be explained First some background from Adams on ‘The Persuasion Filter As my regular readers know the Persuasion Filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality In order for us to be here today our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate They had no need to understand reality at any basic level And we have no such need either That’s why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and I might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine Many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival I like to describe reality as each person living their own movie which works well unless our script’s conflict When that happens one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent That’s how I see the world Last year in this blog I suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what I call the Persuasion Filter That’s what I have been using to make spooky-good predictions about the election so far And that’s what I’ll use today to give you an alternate movie about James Comey Compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the future The base assumption of the Persuasion Filter is that people are irrational 90 of the time and only rarely when no emotions are involved truly rational This is the reverse of the common filter for reality in which people are assumed to be rational 90 of the time and a bit crazy 10 of the time That’s some background for context Read more here So back to Comey Adams asks which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future Some say Comey is a political pawn in a rigged system By that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case But we can’t explain why he’s acting against Clinton’s interests now What changed Well some say Comey had to reopen the case against Clinton after discovering the Weiner laptop emails If he failed to act there might be a revolt at the FBI and maybe a whistleblower would come forward But that leaves unexplained why Comey detailed to Congress how Clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the FBI was dropping the case If Comey had been protecting Clinton on the first round he would have softened his description of her misdeeds wouldn’t he But he didn’t seem to hold back anything And none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know Comey have high regard for his integrity Comey also has the security of a 10-year appointment as Director so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced That’s exactly why the job has a 10-year term Given what we know of Comey before any of the Clinton emails any movie that casts Comey as an ass-covering weasel is probably making a casting mistake So allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts Comey as more of a patriot and hero than an ass-covering weasel Compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predicting My movie says Comey had good evidence against Clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the American public For reasons of conscience and acting as a patriot Comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the FBI found against Clinton The evidence looked damning because it was Under this interpretation Comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the Republic He didn’t want the FBI to steal this important decision away from the people but at the same time he couldn’t let the people decide blind So he divulged the evidence and stepped away like the action hero who doesn’t look back at the explosion In the second act of this movie Comey learns that the Weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag And a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence That would violate Clinton’s rights But Comey couldn’t easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against FBI policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day So Comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the Republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting In this movie Comey did the hero thing He alerted the public to the fact that the FBI found DISQUALIFYING information on the Weiner laptop And he took a second bullet to his reputation How do I know the new emails are that bad I start by assuming Comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions And even Comey’s critics concede he’s smart So The way you know the new emails are disqualifying for Clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed Congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections Comey is smart enough to know his options And unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age he’s got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the Republic According to this movie no matter who gets elected we’ll eventually learn of something disqualifying in the Weiner emails And we can’t say we weren’t warned Comey took two bullets to do it So compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts And when we find out what is in the Weiner laptop emails compare that

      "Foxes in Arctic Alaska are creating beautiful gardens around their dens These 6 to 12 pound foxes mostly prey on lemmings and small game and are found throughout the circumpolar Arctic from Alaska and Canada even up into Europe and Greenland By digging their dens and creating a safe hiding place for their offspring and a home to live in that is safe from the elements they are fertilizing the ground and creating a nutrient rich for plants Some dens are over a century old and due to the harshness of the Arctic frozen ground some dens take years to fully develop Foxes sometimes reuse old den sites or steal dens from smaller animals like squirrels The best dens are the ones that are elevated on ridges mounds or riverbanks Arctic foxes can have litters that contain as many as 16 cubs They deposit high amounts of nutrients in and around their dens through urination defecation and left over kills Because of this fertilization vibrant diamondleaf willows and yellow wildflowers pop up from their dens coloring the otherwise gray landscape These dens exist throughout the Arctic and they turn the otherwise gray landscape into something that is spectacularly beautiful These dens also boost the environment by creating more plant diversity This greatly helps herbivores find food during the short summers which in turn helps carnivores The ongoing cycle provides more food and better health to animals living in an otherwise desolate region Many species such as caribou and other herbivores visit these dens creating a great environment for healthy growth within the ecosystem The cute foxes have been dubbed the ecosystem engineers \n",

      "Tweet Home Gold Gold News Currency Crisis Alasdair MacLeod On The Vexed Question of the Dollar There is little doubt that the rapid expansion of both dollar-denominated debt and monetary quantities since the financial crisis will lead us into a currency crisis We just don’t know when and the dollar is not alone From Alasdair Macleod All the major paper currencies have been massively inflated in recent years With the dollar acting as the world’s reserve currency where the dollar goes so do all the other fiat monies Until that cataclysmic event we watch currencies behave in increasingly unexpected seemingly irrational ways The fundamentals for Japan are not good yet the yen remains the strongest currency of the big four The Eurozone risks a systemic collapse overwhelmed by political and financial headwinds yet the euro’s exchange rate has proved relatively impervious to this deep uncertainty The British economy is strongest yet sterling is the weakest of the four majors If nothing else today’s foreign exchanges are evidence that subjectivity triumphs over macroeconomic thinking Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds beats computer modelling every time Furthermore any official attempt to establish a rate for the dollar has to address two separate questions the value of the dollar relative to other currencies and its purchasing power for goods and services The chart below indicates how the dollar has behaved against other currencies over the last five years both on a trade weighted and on a predefined currency basis (DXY) It should be noted that the dollar has risen on both these measures by roughly 18 since early 2014 At the same time the Chinese yuan has fallen against the dollar by about 12 so it has actually risen slightly against the DXY basket as a whole particularly against the euro component where it has gained 12 since early 2014 This matters because far from devaluing which is what we are routinely told by dollar-centric analysts the yuan has been relatively stable over time against a basket of currencies It has been weak against the dollar and yen but strong against both the euro and sterling We should look at this from the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee’s point of view America runs a record trade deficit with China and the only major economies where China’s terms of trade have improved are with the US, excepting Japan Therefore the Fed is bound to be very sensitive to the dollar’s exchange rate with China’s yuan Furthermore on two occasions when the Fed had signalled it was going to raise the Fed Funds Rate it backed off when the Chinese lowered the rate at which it had pegged the yuan to the dollar Chinese devaluation against the dollar is obviously a prime concern for the Fed The situation becomes better understood when the Peoples Bank’s position is taken into account The bank has been selling US Treasury stock in large quantities stockpiling commodities and oil with the proceeds though it has been diversifying into Japanese Government bonds as well China’s dollars have been welcomed by markets which are short of both quality collateral and raw currency However China’s supply of both has failed to stop the dollar rising against the yuan Furthermore China isn’t the only Asian and Middle Eastern state selling American paper so the demand from other international players on the buy side has been immense enough to determine the underlying direction of the dollar’s exchange rate The situation is being exploited by the Peoples Bank In effect the Peoples Bank is in a position to dictate Fed policy by adjusting the rate at which it is prepared to supply dollars into the market So long as the dollar remains fundamentally strong it only has to slow the pace of Treasury and dollar sales for the dollar to rise and therefore the Fed’s planned interest rate rises to be deferred This is not understood properly by western commentators who erroneously think China is being forced to defend a declining yuan Nothing could be further from the truth It will be interesting to see whether this happens again ahead of the December FOMC meeting when for the umpteenth time we have been promised a rise in the Fed Funds Rate A major consideration behind China’s foreign exchange policy is the outlook for the euro The Eurozone represents a market as large as the US, with the added importance of being tagged onto the Asian continent There can be little doubt that China sees her own long-term future being aligned more with Europe than America despite Europe’s current troubles It is if you like a situation that is primarily of strategic importance Europe’s economy will need rescuing at some stage and is therefore a future opportunity for China’s intervention That plan is for the long term and becomes increasingly valid the deeper the hole the Eurozone digs for itself A disintegration of the EU would also be beneficial for Chinese ambitions Meanwhile in the short-term the euro has broken a crucial trend-line against the dollar having completed a continuation head-and-shoulders pattern targeting the 1.0600 area which is the previous low seen in March and November 2015 This is our second chart Neither the Peoples Bank nor the Fed need to be chart experts to see what’s happening Brexit was very bad news for the euro because it is a racing certainty that the event will turn out to be just the start of a new round of political and economic trouble for the Eurozone The Italian economy in particular is imploding with a non-performing loan problem that is roughly 40 of private sector GDP. So China can for the moment steer a course for the yuan between the euro’s devaluation and the dollar’s rise The Fed sees in euro weakness an increase of currency-induced deflation for the US economy and a loss of competitiveness for US exports Chinese exporters are obvious beneficiaries as well so the blame for deflation will be on China’s foreign exchange machinations Anyway China probably cares less than she ever did about the long-term consequences of her actions on the US economy China has been selling her US Treasuries and reducing her dollar exposure to add to her stockpiles of raw materials and oil She wants to keep her over-indebted businesses trading by maintaining a favourable exchange rate with the dollar particularly given the developing train wreck that’s the Eurozone And there’s not a lot the Fed can do about it Gold and commodities The principal driver for the gold price is the prospect of monetary inflation transmuting into price inflation and the inability of central banks to respond to this threat by raising interest rates sufficiently to control the balance of consumer preferences between goods and holding money We are of course measuring gold in dollars because the latter is the reserve currency for all the others But as stated above there are two exchange considerations the first being the dollar against other currencies and the second the dollar against a basket of commodities And here we should note that over the long-term the prices of commodities measured in gold are considerably more stable than the prices of commodities measured in fiat currencies China has behaved as if she is thoroughly aware of gold’s pricing attributes and has a deliberate policy of dominating the market for bullion This is very different from the US’s domination of gold paper markets Not only has China invested in unprofitable gold mines to become the largest producer at about 450 tonnes annually but the state monopolises China’s refining capacity She also imports doré for refining from other countries and without doubt since 1983 has accumulated substantial quantities of bullion not included in monetary reserves Furthermore it is the only country that has encouraged its population through television and other media to accumulate physical gold Make no mistake for the last thirty-three years the Chinese government has made a credible attempt to gain ultimate control over the physical gold market and to extend gold’s protection to her own citizens China does not manipulate the gold price Instead as described earlier she is manipulating the dollar by regulating the exchange rate and by discouraging the Fed from raising interest rates It is a temporary balancing act that only continues so long as desperate banks and their indebted borrowers continue to scramble for dollars and China knows it The Fed for the moment appears to be powerless to manage economic outcomes and is firmly trapped by China’s currency management with interest rates stuck at the lower bound And to make it worse the weak euro against which the dollar index (DXY) is very heavily weighted (57 threatens to force the DXY index even higher The result inevitably is that monetary policy cannot be used to address future price inflation which virtually guarantees there will be a higher gold price in 2017 and beyond This is why despite American wishful thinking gold remains at the centre of the financial system It is central partly because China’s ensures it is and it is also China’s ultimate money for commodity and trade purposes China most likely has enough gold to fully compensate for her reserve losses from the destruction of the dollar and the other fiat currencies on her reserve book She is deliberately selling down her dollar exposure anyway while she can Lest we forget communist economists in China were taught that capitalism destroys itself For them there is no clearer proof than the performance of the US economy and the dollar and they do not intend to get caught up in its demise Understand this and you understand all While the monetary role of gold in the future has yet to be determined by China and it will be China or the markets that make the decision for the moment it can be regarded as the ultimate insurance against global currency failure \n",

      "Written by Eric Margolis As a former soldier and war correspondent who has covered 14 conflicts I look at all the media hoopla over tightening siege of Mosul Iraq and shake my head This western-organized liberation of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I’ve seen Islamic State (IS) the defender of Mosul is a paper tiger blown out of all proportion by western media IS is as this writer has been saying for years an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents religious fanatics and modern-day anarchists At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader But IS rank and file has no military training little discipline degraded communications and ragged logistics In fact today’s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term ‘bashi-bazouks a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture rapine looting and arson What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature lack of élan and hesitancy In my view ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria’s government just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon Both were cultivated to split the PLO. ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world Western and Kurdish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year Instead western mainly US warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad Don’t be fooled IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa maybe even less The leaders of IS are likely long gone IS has few heavy weapons no air cover at all and poor communications Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers backed by heavy artillery rocket batteries tanks armored vehicles and awesome air power The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish peshmerga fighters Iraqi army and special forces some Syrian Kurds Iranian ‘volunteers irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called advisors plus small numbers of French Canadian and British special forces Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops supported by armor and artillery ready to liberate Iraq which was once part of the Ottoman Empire For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist’s fondest dream native troops led by white officers the model of the old British Indian Raj Washington arms trained equips and financed all its native auxiliaries The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma To be a political movement it was delighted to control Iraq’s second largest city But as a guerilla force it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded This is what’s happening right now In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power as the recent 1967 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover IS forces would best advise to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks Otherwise they risk being destroyed But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa When this happens western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS.
